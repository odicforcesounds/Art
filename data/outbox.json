None of them can be the what they wish to be. </p><p>Woman who become man have no erection and men who become woman, cannot have kids. ( that is the only difference between men and woman ) .. so is all about sexuality. </p><p>If a woman who is a men cannot have an erection, then is a men which cannot be men. If a men which is woman cannot have kids, then is a woman who cannot have kids. </p><p>... the rest is the same.. always the same... so, if I feel myself like a Monkey, why should I become Monkey? </p><p>The difference between men and monkeys are in fact only in the brain, while they have very similar way to be what they are. </p><p>Nothing against your choice, but for me is funny. Billions of people pay to remove health problems, while trans people, pay to have more health problems. </p><p>Yeah, because all transexual will have body problems for the rest of their lifes, while most dedicate their lifes to sex. <br />Again: nothing against prostitution, while is true that few woman pay to have sex, most man can. Happy sexual sessions.. but life is not only about sex, while is true that we are all here because someone did!</p>"},"attachment":[],"tag":[{"type":"Hashtag","href":"https://infosec.exchange/tags/fighting","name":"#fighting"},{"type":"Hashtag","href":"https://infosec.exchange/tags/phobias","name":"#phobias"}],"replies":{"id":"https://infosec.exchange/users/TheChallenge/statuses/110881835970803798/replies","type":"Collection","first":{"type":"CollectionPage","next":"https://infosec.exchange/users/TheChallenge/statuses/110881835970803798/replies?only_other_accounts=true&page=true","partOf":"https://infosec.exchange/users/TheChallenge/statuses/110881835970803798/replies","items":[]}}}},{"id":"https://infosec.exchange/users/TheChallenge/statuses/110881944611418867/activity","type":"Create","actor":"https://infosec.exchange/users/TheChallenge","published":"2023-08-13T10:56:43Z","to":["https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public"],"cc":["https://infosec.exchange/users/TheChallenge/followers"],"object":{"id":"https://infosec.exchange/users/TheChallenge/statuses/110881944611418867","type":"Note","summary":null,"inReplyTo":null,"published":"2023-08-13T10:56:43Z","url":"https://infosec.exchange/@TheChallenge/110881944611418867","attributedTo":"https://infosec.exchange/users/TheChallenge","to":["https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public"],"cc":["https://infosec.exchange/users/TheChallenge/followers"],"sensitive":false,"atomUri":"https://infosec.exchange/users/TheChallenge/statuses/110881944611418867","inReplyToAtomUri":null,"conversation":"tag:infosec.exchange,2023-08-13:objectId=86908439:objectType=Conversation","content":"<p>Just another contradictory &quot;bla bla bla&quot; about sexuality. <br />----<br />life is only a dream and inside that zone, you can be what every you are able to create by your own. <br />----<br />Trans people talk about sexual freedom, but most woman don&#39;t like it, at least for them self&#39;s. </p><p>Trans people talk about being descriminated, while woman keep being victim of being what they are. <br />I mean, this values that are older than the &quot;new change&quot; that science can make, are issues that most should can to fix. <br />In that aspect, transex give woman support on that, while woman support transex.
