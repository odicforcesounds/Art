    <p>
      As the Monkey who doesn't listen, lost in a world unseen,<br>
      I embark on a Shamanic Quest, a dream within my being.<br>
      Illusions guide my steps, a vision I hold here,<br>
      But to make it real, I seek Tiger and Dragon near to me.<br>

      In this moment of wonder, I tread with uncertainty,<br>
      Yearning to break free from the chains of my own reality.<br>
      With eyes closed, I envision a path of shields before me,<br>
      A journey that requires the Tiger and Dragon's camaraderie.<br>

      Oh, wise Tiger, with your sight keen and true,<br>
      Unveil the hidden truths, illuminate the path I must pursue.<br>
      Guide me through the maze of illusions and deceit,<br>
      So my dream may manifest, my purpose complete.<br>

      Mighty Dragon, keeper of silent wisdom profound,<br>
      Grant me the power to speak, to break free from this bound.<br>
      Teach me the language of ancient core and insight,<br>
      That I may find my voice and take flight.<br>

      Together, as a trio, we transcend the limits of our mind,<br>
      The Monkey, the Tiger, and Dragon, harmonizing day and night.<br>
      With a path of shields in hand, we forge ahead with bravery,<br>
      Creating a reality that surpasses mere reverie.<br>

      Oh, I can open my ears,<br>
      To the whispers of guidance that dispel my fears.<br>
      Embrace Monkey's vision, the Dragon's silent speech,<br>
      And our Shamanic Quest dream, within us, we will reach.<br>

      In the flow of life's dance, we find unity and connection,<br>
      Each sign contributing to our shared human reflection.<br>
      With the Tiger's sight, the Dragon's wisdom spoken,<br>
      We weave a concert of dreams, with barriers broken.<br>

      So, let the <a href="./pages/OscarFM/index.html">Monkey</a> in me, awake and see,<br>
      The power within, the path that's meant to be.<br>
      With Tiger and Dragon, united as one,<br>
      We'll make this Shamanic Quest Dream, as reality, brightly spun.
