    <p>
      In the world of boundless freedom, there stands<br>
      A person unrestrained, with wide-open hands.<br>
      No limits, no boundaries, their spirit untamed,<br>
      Unfettered by norms, untamed and unblamed.<br>

      With every breath, they inhale liberation's air,<br>
      Embracing their essence with unabashed flair.<br>
      No shackles to confine, no rules to abide,<br>
      They dance to their rhythm, their unique stride.<br>

      Their mind knows no borders, no walls, no chains,<br>
      Unveiling the treasures that innovation sustains.<br>
      With each thought, they soar, exploring the unknown,<br>
      Unafraid to question, to seek and to own.<br>

      In the world of acceptance, their being unfolds,<br>
      A party of colors, a story untold.<br>
      No judgments to weigh them, no doubts to control,<br>
      They bask in the light of their authentic soul.<br>

      Every facet, every quirk, they proudly display,<br>
      No need for conformity, no need to obey.<br>
      They celebrate their quirks, their flaws, their might,<br>
      For they are the embodiment of pure delight.<br>

      With every step, they tread on uncharted ground,<br>
      Forging a path where true freedom is found.<br>
      No limits imposed, no chains to impede,<br>
      They shape their destiny, fueled by their creed.<br>

      In their presence, others find solace and peace,<br>
      As they grant them permission to find their release.<br>
      They inspire, empower, their essence so pure,<br>
      Encouraging others to embrace and endure.<br>

      In a world that seeks conformity's embrace,<br>
      They stand tall, challenging the status quo's trace.<br>
      For they believe in the power of authenticity,<br>
      And the transformative force it holds with tenacity.<br>

      So let them roam, let them shine and explore,<br>
      For their spirit unbounded holds infinite core.<br>
      With full permissions granted, they'll reach the sublime,<br>
      A beacon of freedom, transcending all time.<br>

      In their freedom, they inspire others to see,<br>
      The limitless potential that lies within you and me.<br>
      For in embracing our truth, our essence unveiled,<br>
      We become the masters of the stories we've hailed.
