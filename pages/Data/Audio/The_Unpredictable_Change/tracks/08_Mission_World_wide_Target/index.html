    <p>
      In the party of existence, a soul emerges,<br>
      Saved from the abyss, by divine urges.<br>
      Rescued by the will of one held as divine,<br>
      A mission entrusted, a purpose to define.<br>

      For this chosen one, a quest of grand scale,<br>
      A dream so vast, to make the world prevail.<br>
      Bound by a vision that unites all hearts,<br>
      A call to action, where unity imparts.<br>

      From every corner, people gather near,<br>
      Moved by the cause, casting away fear.<br>
      A symphony of voices, harmonizing as one,<br>
      A chorus of dreams, together they're spun.<br>

      In the depths of their souls, the fire ignites,<br>
      A collective force, pushing for greater heights.<br>
      No longer divided, but united they stand,<br>
      Hand in hand, embracing the command.<br>

      Through trials and tribulations, they forge ahead,<br>
      Each step guided by the words once said.<br>
      With unwavering faith, they persevere,<br>
      Fueling the dream, erasing doubt and fear.<br>

      Across oceans and borders, cultures connected,<br>
      The mission transcending what divides humankind.<br>
      A party woven with threads of hope,<br>
      As aspirations merge and limitations elope.<br>

      The power of unity, a force so strong,<br>
      Carrying the dream, propelling it along.<br>
      A testament to the human spirit's might,<br>
      When joined in purpose, they illuminate the night.<br>

      And as the chosen one witnesses this grand sight,<br>
      Their dream unfurling in the radiant light,<br>
      They realize the truth in this sacred quest,<br>
      That together, they are invincible, truly blessed.<br>

      For in the hands of many, dreams take flight,<br>
      Guided by love, compassion, and inner light.<br>
      And as the world unites to fulfill their dreams,<br>
      They see that they are more than what it seems.<br>

      So, let the mission continue, forever unbound,<br>
      As hearts beat as one, with a resounding sound.<br>
      For in the pursuit of dreams, the world is reborn,<br>
      And the chosen one, hailed as a true champion.
