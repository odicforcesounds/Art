    <p>
      From lands near and far, where hope may seem dim,<br>
      Children and the poor gather in a humble hymn.<br>
      With earnest eyes and hearts filled with grace,<br>
      They whisper a message, a plea to embrace.<br>

      "Care for us," they implore, their voices so pure,<br>
      In unity they stand, their struggles endured.<br>
      In their innocence, wisdom they possess,<br>
      A profound truth that transcends any excess.<br>

      For in their simple lives, they find solace and joy,<br>
      Embracing the treasures that hardships employ.<br>
      They teach us the value of compassion's embrace,<br>
      And remind us of the beauty found in each face.<br>

      With open hearts, they offer a sacred deal,<br>
      Their humble plea, a bond that's real.<br>
      "Care for us, and we shall care for you,<br>
      In communion of moments, our spirits renew."<br>

      In their laughter and smiles, the world finds its light,<br>
      A beacon of hope in the darkest of night.<br>
      Through their resilience, they teach us to share,<br>
      To lift one another, to show others we care.<br>

      So let us not forget these souls so dear,<br>
      Their dreams and aspirations, crystal clear.<br>
      For the values we hold dear, they embody too,<br>
      Their well-being, a testament to what we should do.<br>

      In the party of life, let our actions align,<br>
      With the song of the children, with the poor's silent sign.<br>
      For in caring for them, we care for ourselves,<br>
      A bond of humanity that forever compels.<br>

      So heed their call, let compassion guide our way,<br>
      In their upliftment, a brighter world we display.<br>
      For when we care for the least among us all,<br>
      We nurture a love that stands firm and tall.
