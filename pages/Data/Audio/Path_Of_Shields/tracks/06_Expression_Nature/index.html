      Nature's expression, both simple and complex,<br>
      Guides us to understand, to truly connect.<br>
      In its simplicity, <a href="../../../Dao_Touch/tracks/07_Fragments_You_Need/">fragments</a> of intricate design,<br>
      And within complexity, traces of simplicity shine.<br><br>

      Just like Nature's expression, I too exist,<br>
      And I see no problem with the drugs some insist.<br>
      Let me explain, for logic guides my thought,<br>
      Those who partake, knowledge they have sought.<br><br>

      Chemistry and understanding of the body's ways,<br>
      Drugs are explored with <a href="../../../Emotional_Signals/tracks/11_Social_Tool_Kit/">consciousness</a> ablaze.<br>
      Shared experiences, wisdom imparted,<br>
      Ensuring risks are minimized, not disregarded.<br><br>

      For drugs are ubiquitous, in various forms they reside,<br>
      From coffee to tobacco, they're found far and wide.<br>
      Shall we speak of pharmaceuticals, altering brain's flow,<br>
      A cure, a <a href="../../../Machine_World/tracks/03_Control_Free_to_Ask/">control</a> , educating minds to grow.<br><br>

      But I don't embrace the anti-drug campaigns,<br>
      History has shown the same outcome it contains.<br>
      Alcohol, once forbidden, bred violence and strife,<br>
      A testament that prohibition can bring forth a dark life.<br><br>

      Yet I stand <a href="../../../Path_Of_Shields/tracks/13_Against_the_Greed/">against</a> those who impose their power,<br>
      Manipulating others in the shadows they tower.<br>
      But those who choose to partake, without harm or dismay,<br>
      Without causing instability or troubles' array.<br><br>

      Marijuana, Cannabis, a calming sense bestowed,<br>
      LSD, a journey, a personalized <a href="../../../The_Long_Road/tracks/09_Developing_Unkown_Code/">code</a> <br>

      These experiences, a gateway to expanded perception,<br>
      Resonance heightened, electrifying connection.<br><br>

      Telepathic whispers may dance in the air,<br>
      For communication transcends words, I declare.<br>
      Drugs or no drugs, we share a profound link,<br>
      A festival of unspoken words, a thought's distinct wink.<br><br>

      But guns and <a href="../../../The_Long_Road/tracks/08_I_am_Music/">bombs</a>, expressions of darkness and dread,<br>
      Nature didn't create them, they're born from human's thread.<br>
      Choice without conscience, the path we must beware,<br>
      Nature's tools aren't meant for destruction and despair.<br><br>

      For in Nature's embrace, harmony is found,<br>
      Tools bestowed upon creatures that astound.<br>
      But as humans, we must tread with <a href="../../../The_Unpredictable_Change/tracks/06_Care_us_and_we_will_care_you/">care</a>,<br>
      Respecting the gifts, the burdens we bear.<br><br>

      Nature's expression, a symphony so grand,<br>
      Within its complexity, simplicity expands.<br>
      Let us honor its wisdom, its lessons impart,<br>
      Embracing the beauty, with a mindful heart.
