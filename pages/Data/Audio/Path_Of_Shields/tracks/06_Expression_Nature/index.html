				>Nature (made to help us) to understand its simplicity<br />
				Nature (made to help us) to understand its complexity<br />
				Simplicity have many fragments of complexity<br />
				and complexity have many fragments of simplicity<br />
				In both sides of its natural Expression!<br />
				It is no more than an expression of Nature!<br />
				Like I am...<br />
				I dont see any problems with any kind of drugs<br />
				I will tell you why, but remember I use Logic.<br />
				People like to enjoy body experiences<br />
				People who take drugs, normally read already about the effects<br />
				Normally they understand chemistry, they study and use their brain<br />
				They understand the body and do it with more people who have experience
				or conscience<br />
				Taking Drugs dont put others in risk ( is most cases is true sometimes
				does )<br />
				If there is no conscience of the one who take drugs<br />
				But, drugs are everywhere<br />
				Because even Coffee or Tea or Tabaco or Sugar are Drugs<br />
				Should I talk about psy pharma ( Drugs to stop the Brain activity, not
				to "cure" )<br />
				Cure others in the sense of mind, is educating other on how to use the
				mind.<br />
				I dont really accept this (anti drug legal movements)<br />
				Since by experience and Life history in societies did result in the
				same...<br />
				Alcohol had the same results we are gettings this days with other kind
				of drugs<br />
				Alcohol was forbidden, violence to have alcohol commercialized happen<br />
				gangsters and many other kind of violent groups<br />
				that I believe they disappear if there is nothing agaist their
				choices<br />
				Their free choice to consume and do nothing with their bodies<br />
				Because We all have to gain money to dream as a condition to live<br />
				Even if we didnt use any kind of money, exchange of goods happen
				always<br />
				Even Love is a Business, with or without Money! ( You have an agreenment
				)<br />
				...<br />
				I am agains those who impose their will of power to gain power of
				Will<br />
				which means, using drugs with a girl to make sex with her<br />
				but I am not against someone who just take drugs and do stupid things<br />
				but doesnt disturm anyone, doesnt create instability, doesnt create
				troubles<br />
				Marijuana or Pot or Cannabis are made to give to the consumer a sense of
				being calm<br />
				LSD give visual allucinations (going to a movie that is designed for You
				and by You)<br />
				All those experiences<br />
				Give an opportunity to gain higher conscience and more accurate
				perceptions of reality<br />
				Open ( the resonance channel )<br />
				the electromagnetic fields become more sensible<br />
				Then, sometimes, it give an idea of having telepathic communications<br />
				if people have that skill already<br />
				which in many cases ( it was communication )<br />
				Because We do communicate without talking!!! ( with or without drugs
				)<br />
				...<br />
				I believe that any drug can be and give an expression of nature<br />
				but I can only accept that Guns or Bombs are an expression of Nature<br />
				If we are not Conscience about our own choices<br />
				Because, Nature didnt create more tools to kill<br />
				It gives tools to those animals that depend on that tool<br />
				As they born with those tools in their body!!!<br />
