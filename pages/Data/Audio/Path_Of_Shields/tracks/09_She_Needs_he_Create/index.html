      Inspiring hearts, empowering hands.<br>

      In a world fraught with turmoil and despair,<br>
      You reminded us of the importance to care.<br>
      To nurture our planet, our shared home,<br>

      And pave the way for a future that transcends.<br>

      Severn Cullis Suzuki, your inspiration lives on,<br>
      Guiding us to rise, to act as one.<br>
