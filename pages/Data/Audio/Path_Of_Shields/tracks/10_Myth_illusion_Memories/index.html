				what is real? what is not an interpretation? what is fantasy? what are
				illusions? what is myth? what are memories? Lets admit We all focus on
				illusions we work on illusions we design illusions we structure
				illusions using logic and creativity we get deep each illusion so hard
				that we spend a life time on our illusions so one day we can create them
				I don't understand any of the specifications of how much complexity can
				be described in sense of those who don't accept a simple expression of
				an inside interpretation, where all use the same tools to express their
				own illusion of true but I know what makes this world what it is is
				because illusions were dreamed not only by singular persons but by many.
				Any answer is an inside search and an inside research. Logic is good for
				work sensitivity and resonance is good for living. Where are you in the
				moment of telling where others shall start their journey of finding the
				self? There is no absolute truth about how we are but a fragment of true
				about what we had express there only one holy true humanity have several
				individual expressions that are them self's teaching formulas that
				hack's others brain others illusions with new illusions with new desires
				to find a reason to say ( my truth is absolute ) ... well, Even Taoism
				can be expressed in several fragments of simplicity which will result is
				a mix of several complexities that are expressions of simplicity as
				well. The more You know the more You think You need to go deep while You
				know You should accept simplicity! Is good You know... is about this
				dream that in many billions of cases are consider madness.. people are
				crazy.. oh he/she see things I cannot.. well, that is a skill of
				creativity to express their illusions.. are they crazy or they develop a
				reality we cannot see because we are not paying attention? Well, it is
				an obsessive loop while most of the professionals who try to cure are in
				a obsessive loop to test and "pray" to find a positive result which in
				most of the cases, didnt find a cure, but a way to stop the obsessive
				brain activity which care that illusion.. Well.. While this people have
				not the desire to punish people or create them impositions of behaviors
				they are fine..they are not crazy at all.. they can learn and get better
				well, even when we live in a system that needs to "impose" rules which
				are as well, illusions.. ( necessary illusions )
