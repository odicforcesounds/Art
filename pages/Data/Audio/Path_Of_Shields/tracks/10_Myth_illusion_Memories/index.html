      what is real?<br />
      what is not an interpretation? <br />
      what is
      <a href="../../../Shamanic_Quest_Dream/tracks/02_We_Bring_Fire/index.html">Fantasy</a>? <br />
      what are illusions? <br />
      what is myth? <br />
      what are memories? <br />
      Lets admit. We all focus on illusions, we work on illusions, we design
      illusions, we structure illusions using logic and creativity, we get
      deep each illusion so
      <a href="../../../Shiva_and_Kali_Dance/tracks/02_Hard_Work_Deep_Discipline/index.html">hard</a>, that we spend a life time on our illusions so one day we can create
      them.<br />
      I don't understand any of the specifications, of how much complexity is
      needed to describe, the sense of those who don't accept a simple
      expression of an inside interpretation, where all use the same tools to
      express their own illusion of true, but I know what makes this world
      what it is, is because illusions were dreamed not only by singular
      persons but by many.<br />
      Any answer is an inside search and an inside research.<br />
      Logic is good for work, sensitivity and resonance is good for living.
      <br />
      Where are you in the moment of telling where others shall start their
      journey of finding the self? <br />There is no absolute truth about how
      we are, but a fragment of true about what we had express, the only true
      is, humanity have several individual expressions that are them self's,
      teaching formulas that hack's others brain, others illusions with new
      illusions, with new desires, to find a reason to say ( my truth is
      <a href="../../../Shamanic_Quest_Dream/tracks/27_Absolute/index.html">Absolute</a>
      )
      ... well, Even
      <a href="../../../../../YinYang/Dao/index.html">Daoism</a> can be
      expressed in several
      <a href="../../../Dao_Touch/tracks/07_Fragments_You_Need/index.html">fragments</a>
      of <a href="../../../../../YinYang/WhoWeAre/index.html">simplicity</a>,
      which will result is a mix of several complexities, that are expressions
      of simplicity as well. The more You know, the more You think You need to go deep, while You
      know You should accept simplicity! <br />Is good You know, is about this
      <a href="../../../Dao_Expression/tracks/05_Hunting_Dreams_Hunters/index.html">dream</a>
      that in many billions of cases are consider madness.<br />
      People are crazy.. oh he/she see things I cannot.. <br />
      well, that is a
      <a href="../../../Shiva_and_Kali_Dance/tracks/03_United_Colors_of_Skeleton/index.html">Skill</a>
      of creativity, to express their illusions. Are they crazy or they
      <a href="../../../The_Long_Road/tracks/09_Developing_Unkown_Code/index.html">develop</a>
      a imaginary reality we cannot see, because we are not paying attention?
      <br />
      Well, it is an obsessive loop, while most of the professionals who try
      to cure, are in a obsessive loop to test and "pray", to find a positive
      result, which in most of the cases, didn't find a cure, but a way to
      stop the obsessive brain activity, which care that illusion.<br />
      Well.. While this people have not the desire to punish people or create
      them impositions of behaviors, they are fine, they are not crazy at all,
      they can learn and become better<br />
      even when we live in a system that needs to "impose" rules, which are as
      well, illusions. <br />
      ( necessary illusions )
