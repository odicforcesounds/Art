				Sun Wukong / Humanan / Shiva / Kali / Buddha / Jesus Christ<br />
				///<br />
				If You had read me, You know Gods in Paganism<br />
				Care to accept that other Gods expression,
				<br />are by the Will of the, Suprime God Naturally, <br />
				because We are living a spiritual Life (in reality)<br />
				We are God Expression in form of other Name<br />
				Names are given to express Choices ( Attitudes )<br />
				Odin have an expression of a supreme God who Love Animals and Nature His
				Son, Thor, have another expression ( making different choices )<br />
				The supreme God cannot express him self as an Image<br />
				But he Can express him self by choices!<br />
				...<br />
				Warriors... <br />
				Dark Warriors produce Light<br />
				and<br />
				Light Warriors produce Darkness<br />
				...<br />
				More than Logic can be proven with science<br />
				Put everything of Fire ( Light )<br />
				Throw water on it ( Dark )<br />
				...<br />
				It works is the same perspective to almost everything we know<br />
				Another example:<br />
				You educate a child like billions of mothers and fathers do<br />
				While having a instable relation<br />
				That create instability to this child<br />
				Can Create darkness in his/her personality/soul<br />
				And is Logic.. he/she "see" it..<br />
				( already use what we call: common sense )<br />
				Made of Pure Resonance!<br />
				While the repetition of that information in life experience<br />
				Can lead her/him to be like that, sooner or latter!<br />
				Since if it was the reverse example<br />
				A child who had a perfect life<br />
				It would do the same<br />
				because it was his positive condition of life experience<br />
				but Too much positivity is Crazy and Madness!<br />
				(it will be fine, dont worry) - sounds Super Evil<br />
				... I like positive results<br />
				but I dont expect them all the time<br />
				Because reality prove to be itself, instable<br />
				"darkness" is where the knowledge is, when darkness is trying to
				demonstrate "power" to light, it means that light is not paying
				attention to the right point.. if light is not well pointed, then light
				produce more darkness.. by it's will of reaching the illusion is focused
				in..
