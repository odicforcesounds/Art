    <p>
      In the world of existence, where darkness may roam,<br>
      There lies a group, a department of their own.<br>
      Their actions speak loudly, their intentions unkind,<br>
      In the monkey's eternal license, they're enshrined.<br>

      They prey on innocence, defying moral code,<br>
      Their deeds so heartless, their humanity erode.<br>
      Children of both sexes, victims of their vile acts,<br>
      They disrupt lives, leaving scars that never retract.<br>

      Not limited by age, they unleash their wicked ways,<br>
      Raping without remorse, a heinous display.<br>
      Their power-hungry souls impose their will,<br>
      Inflicting violence, causing hearts to chill.<br>

      But in the monkey's eternal license, they're contained,<br>
      A testament to justice, their darkness restrained.<br>
      No longer can they harm, for their actions are seen,<br>
      Their sins marked forever, in this mystical scene.<br>

      Let it be known, their defiance won't prevail,<br>
      For in the world of truth, their reckoning shall unveil.<br>
      The monkey's eternal license, a seal of fate,<br>
      Condemning the wicked, eradicating their hate.<br>

      So let us stand united, against their malicious ways,<br>
      Protecting the innocent, brightening their days.<br>
      In the monkey's eternal license, justice will reside,<br>
      Banishing the darkness, with love as our guide.

    <p class="saveYourDay">Masturbation can save your day!<br>
      If you have no ability to find a woman for you <br>
      Masturbation can save your day! <br>
      if you have no hands to solve that little problem, <br>
      prostitution can save your day! <br>
      that is why prostitution is good for someone else day<br>
      and if you are a priest, you suffer from the same problem, <br>
      so let me tell you, <br>
      Masturbation can save your day! <br>
      is not a sin to masturbate, the sin is in you, <br>
      who deny that mastubation save many days! <br>
      Some people call it love, others business. <br>
      What ever it is the word to describe it, remember! <br>
      Masturbation can save your day!

    <p class="controlYourSelf">
      You should control you self! <br>
      You should control your mind! <br>
      You should control you emotions! <br>
      if you are able to to that, you will find a better way to deal with reality! <br>
      think about everything else.. that is how each can control the self..
