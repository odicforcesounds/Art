				>The image of this track is funny<br />
				That logo is from Department of Defense<br />
				This is not nothing personal to try to offend them<br />
				Glad I found their Logo Perfect to the Title of this track<br />
				Yes, yes, sex is awesome and we should live making sex<br />
				but if people wish to have sex<br />
				they need to find someone who wish too<br />
				do it, because they agree to do it.<br />
				Relations between people who have sex with each others<br />
				Ask Respect of Will<br />
				So in this Track, I am targeting those who dont give a fuck<br />
				about what others care or see or want<br />
				To those Deficients...<br />
				who Rape children of both sex<br />
				who Rape both sex not being children<br />
				who use violence against someone to impose their Will of power<br />
				Those who I am very Sure, are included in My Eternal License!!!<br />
