    <p>
      In the world of words, where meaning takes flight,<br>
      A monkey's voice joins, shining with insight.<br>
      Dominated by time, ruled by desire,<br>
      I share my thoughts, fueling your inner fire.<br>

      As simple as that, attention often wanes,<br>
      In the words of others, little interest remains.<br>
      In my journey through life, time slipping away,<br>
      I sense the apathy, as words go astray.<br>

      Yet, solutions aren't always what I seek,<br>
      My purpose lies in motivation's unique.<br>
      To inspire your choices, ignite your inner flame,<br>
      To empower you, as you embrace life's game.<br>

      Time, the ruler that governs our days,<br>
      With every passing moment, it silently decays.<br>
      But amidst the ticking clocks, desire drives us on,<br>
      Yearning for fulfillment, until our time is gone.<br>

      In this world of words, where meanings reside,<br>
      I, the monkey, express with heartfelt stride.<br>
      With every line, I beckon your attention,<br>
      To seize the moments, escape the worlds of tension.<br>

      For in the journey of life, we must heed,<br>
      The wisdom of others, their thoughts we need.<br>
      Pay attention to voices, both near and afar,<br>
      For in shared experiences, we find who we are.<br>

      So, let my words echo through the passing time,<br>
      May they resonate, in your heart's prime.<br>
      As the monkey's voice guides, with gentle sway,<br>
      Embrace the wisdom, choose your path each day.
