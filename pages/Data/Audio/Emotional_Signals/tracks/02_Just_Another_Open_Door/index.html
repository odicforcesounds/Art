				>I am the Gate Keeper, the Portal and the Path. Pay attention, You may
				find new doors open. Do You wish to come with me? Stay where You are and
				read, feel and learn! Doors can open or close. Do You know what doors
				give You? Experience, while You gave Your Self to it. I am a door, while
				You are a door as well. I talk to my self, while you read, I talk to
				You. Decisions are not always the best, while is only me or You. Making
				wrong decisions can lead us to learn, but is not logic that we will
				learn. Making good decisions can lead us to be secure, but is not logic
				to be secure. Security is needed, as information to care decisions.
				Limits are needed, as decisions which care information. Pay attention to
				your decisions, they are not part of your expressions.
