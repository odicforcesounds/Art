      Facebook Concept Proof for Artist Promotion<br>
      made by Boom Festival In the Year 2016<br>
      World Wide Shamanic Call <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In untamed paths, where mystic winds do roam,<br>
      A shamanic call from Boom's sacred home.<br>
      In the year of 2016, whispers in the breeze,<br>
      "We came in peace," echoing through the trees.<br>

      Across vast lands and waters, it did resound,<br>
      A beckoning to souls, in search profound.<br>
      Amongst the seekers, two spirits embraced,<br>
      <a href="../../../Shamanic_Quest_Dream/tracks/14_Piano_Words/index.html">Monkey</a> and Little Dragon, their destinies traced.<br>

      Monkey, agile and mischievous in his way,<br>
      With nimble steps, he'd dance and sway.<br>
      His <a href="../../../Dao_Expression/tracks/06_Eyes_On_You/index.html">eyes</a> ablaze with a spark of ancient <a href="../../../Shamanic_Quest_Dream/tracks/02_We_Bring_Fire/index.html">fire</a>,<br>
      A jester's heart, filled with boundless desire.<br>

      Little Dragon, small yet fierce, a force untold,<br>
      In her essence, secrets of the ancients unfold.<br>
      Her scales shimmered with ethereal grace,<br>
      A guardian spirit, with wisdom in her embrace.<br>

      Through Boom's gates they ventured, hand in hand,<br>
      A trance zone awaited, where worlds would expand.<br>
      In vibrant hues, the stage was set aflame,<br>
      As rhythms pulsated, their souls became untamed.<br>

      Monkey, with his tricks, leapt high and low,<br>
      His laughter echoed, setting hearts aglow.<br>
      Through the <a href="../../../Path_Of_Shields/tracks/24_Night_Universe/index.html">night</a>, he wove tales with his art,<br>
      Unveiling the mysteries hidden deep in the heart.<br>

      Little Dragon, with her breath of ancient core,<br>
      Whispered wisdom, like never heard before.<br>
      Her serpentine <a href="../../../Shamanic_Quest_Dream/tracks/16_Dance_Like_Water/index.html">dance</a>, a spellbinding sight,<br>
      Guiding lost souls toward the path of light.<br>

      Together they weaved enchantment and delight,<br>
      In the shamanic world, where day turned to night.<br>
      Their energies combine, a harmonious blend,<br>
      <a href="../../../Dao_Expression/tracks/02_Awakening_Dreams/index.html">Awakening</a> spirits, on a journey without end.<br>

      As the trance zone embraced the cosmic <a href="../../../The_Flow_of_Energy/tracks/07_Qi/index.html">flow</a>,<br>
      Monkey and Little Dragon, with spirits aglow,<br>
      They carried the essence of Boom's sacred call,<br>
      Spreading love and unity, touching one and all.<br>

      From that year of 2016, their story took flight,<br>
      A timeless tale of <a href="../../../Deep_Random_Meanings/tracks/07_Magical_Box/index.html">magic</a>, in the worlds of light.<br>
      In every heart that danced to the shamanic <a href="../../../Deep_Random_Meanings/tracks/03_Beat_Flow/index.html">beat</a>,<br>
      Monkey and Little Dragon's presence shall greet.
