                <b>Emotional Signals</b> have some keys that in most of the cases are <a href="../Tao_Touch/tracks/07_Fragments_You_Need/index.html">Forgotten</a>,
                  many others obvious and others, perfect answers that you are asking right
                  <a href="./tracks/03_Bigger_or_Equal_to_Zero/index.html">now</a>.
                The first simplified description about human
                <a href="./tracks/06_Dominated_by_Time_Ruled_by_Desire/index.html">existence</a> that is the main problem to free people from this mad system, comes when they open the first
                <a href="./tracks/02_Just_Another_Open_Door/index.html">door</a> that have the key to open many other doors, and create
                <a href="./tracks/10_The_Game_Project/index.html">fun</a> solutions to give humanity the change to survive the next centuries.
                Everything we create, starts in our brain as a simple <a href="./tracks/05_Magnetic_Condition_Psy_Cats/index.html">symbolic</a> illusion.
                Since illusions are true, because they are the root of creation, creativity is part of intelligence expression.
                While all that our brain express is mathmatic expressed as well, which means, any concept of spirituality is Science!
                Our behaviors in society are the reflected by education, that others will get as <a href="./tracks/04_Tao_Yin_Yang/index.html">feedback</a>.
                While we talk about "education", which is all about our behaviors, we create conditions, which will always create <a href="./tracks/07_Little_Box_Universe_1/index.html">Expressions</a>!
                Those who are not light sensitive need to use some
                <a href="./tracks/09_Shamanic_Visions/index.html">drugs</a>, to gain higher and deeper conscience of reality.
                As I told you before, this is a
                <a href="./tracks/01_We_Came_in_Peace/index.html">peaceful</a> message as Monkey believe, he came in peace.
            This emerge of divine voices is very rare because they come into someone’s life if that one, have shamanic sensitive perceptions, and for that is needed to live in a constant flow without blocking anything from the Outside.
                From there, a
                <a href="./tracks/13_Trust_Constant_Loop/index.html">positive</a> path and will, is a must to survive.
                <span style="color:green;">Monkey</span> solution is to solve
                <a href="./tracks/11_Social_Tool_Kit/index.html">social</a> problems, and because problems are solved by a process where we need to test everything, meaning we need
                a constant
                <a href="./tracks/12_Hacking_Festival/index.html">wrongness</a>, to find the best choice, in this magnetic
                <a href="./tracks/06_Dominated_by_Time_Ruled_by_Desire/index.html">conditional</a> world, that have no time to explore life as it should.</span></p>
