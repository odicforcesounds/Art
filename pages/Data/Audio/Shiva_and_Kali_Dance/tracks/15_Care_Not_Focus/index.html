      Care not, dear monkey, but let your focus be,<br>
      For this note holds wisdom, let it set you free.<br>
      In the passage of time, we find our way,<br>
      With careful choices, we shape each passing day.<br>

      Take a moment to pause, to tend and to mend,<br>
      For the things we care for, time will surely lend.<br>
      With precision, we navigate life's winding course,<br>
      Knowing that choice holds its own potent force.<br>

      Choice knows no boundaries, it transcends time's hold,<br>
      In its world, we shape stories yet to be told.<br>
      So, care not for the ticking hands on the clock,<br>
      But focus on the choices, like keys to unlock.<br>

      For time marches on, relentless and swift,<br>
      Yet within its confines, our choices uplift.<br>
      In the party of life, our threads are weaved,<br>
      With each choice, a stitch, a path to be believed.<br>

      Care not for the constraints that time may impose,<br>
      But focus on the present, where true power grows.<br>
      With each choice, we mold our destiny's design,<br>
      Aligning our path with purpose, so divine.<br>

      So, heed this important note, dear monkey so wise,<br>
      Take time to care for the things that make you rise.<br>
      In the precisions of time, let your choices shine,<br>
      For in each mindful act, your essence will align.<br>

      Care not, but focus, with intent and with grace,<br>
      Navigating time's currents, finding your rightful place.<br>
      Embrace the power of choice, as time slips away,<br>
      And create a life that shines brighter each day.
