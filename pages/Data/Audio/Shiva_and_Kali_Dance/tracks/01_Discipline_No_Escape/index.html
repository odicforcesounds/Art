           <p> Sadly or not, but true. For any kind of community we need organization, which include many levels of disciplines. Disciplines come in a condition of "there is no escape" or "there is no other way to deal with". Well, while Order can create Disorder because is not being sensible to it, Disorder Create Condition of Order. So make Your Choices, Wisely! Even when both order and disorder are part of the same expression of organization, I do not like the concept which needs to say that reality have  order or disorder. This always remembers me choices. I do not like to make choices, but I sugest possibilities. I like disorder because disorder have expressions that dance in form of art. While life is somehow a disorder flow, we know that even disorder have order.  While order do not always give conditions of freedom, in the sense of respecting each one will in form of his own expression. Disorder accept all kind of expressions as a free condition of the disorder it self, accepting simplicity of each intentional will to learn about him/her self. A natural behavior of any living being that is testing reality. Being crazy in sense of those who judge, is not bad, because we all talk alone or sing, to feel how is being Free! I see order in disorder, because I accept irregularity and it's own metamorphosis in everything I do not really care about all fragment that compose, each singular expression of life or interpretation, as I am at the same time, the same. I accept disorder because I am in a perfect order of disorder, while to be true to myself, I don't like the disorder that is created by any human who is the only who is able to make choices, and his/her choice is to create more problems in the name of his/her Egocentric Will of Power, thinking only in his/her benefits only, because we can release our animality and feed it, becoming everything we do feed, and that focused content is not health to any living being, even worst if that living being can make a choice. My Life Experience... in Body... with Brain... All connected to the experience of their dance of Love I call it Spiritual. Can You give me permition to simplify this simple complexity called reality? Well, more than thinking, doing, since illusions are in our brain to give us the opportunity to refuse them or build them! Remmebers me the Matrix, where the problem is choice! So this is very simple. Society express the problem In a conditional living state of my existence, made in a random intention, which society did create. I create a solution so You can make a choice.  My choice was to express it, not to create it! But at the same time I do wish to create, I am building it! It is controversial in fact, but that is the bridge I like most, between Order and Disorder! If Society creates Disorder it is logic that a new order need to be expressed. Life is like that metamorphosis ( that is accepting simplicity ). Maybe this message that is spiritual, which logicly is political!
