				<b>Shiva and Kali Dance</b> is a fully description of the full vision
				and a fully message of the prevision. Because humanity and harmonic life
				in community needs
				<a href="./tracks/01_Discipline_No_Escape/index.html">discipline</a>,
				there isn’t any way to escape from it to have positive results to human
				balance existence. Humanity should have time to make a deep
				<a href="./tracks/02_Hard_Work_Deep_Discipline/index.html"
					>concentration</a
				>, because they have those
				<a href="./tracks/03_United_Colors_of_Skeleton/index.html">skills</a>
				and because they had learned how important they are, from human history.
				It was the moment to learn about <b>Chakras</b> theories and use them,
				as my active chakra is represented as a burning box as
				<a href="./tracks/05_Yellow_Energy_Burning_Box/index.html"
					>yellow energy</a
				>. As human, I breath air, and this reality surrounded by

				electricity, which

				us with magnetism, the

				attraction. Even accepting that all this message would have a
				<a href="./tracks/12_Delay_Expectative/index.html">delay</a>, I need to
				<a href="./tracks/15_Care_Not_Focus/index.html">focus</a> in real
				solutions because Dao will, was to gain harmony itself in this world
				wide competition full of parties and celebrations. Because that, and
				because my personal situation ask for simple solutions, I target
				<a

					>Boom Festival</a
				>
				to make a real world wide Boom, in my first
				<a href="./tracks/08_First_Contact_Path_of_Shields/index.html"
					>contact</a
				>, asking a path of shields, not only to protect anyone who can be
				unprotected but because Dao ask for it. From the underground, more
				deeply from
				<a href="./tracks/06_Underwater_Into_the_Sky/index.html">underwater</a>,
				I should get the Sky for the love of all human race. As harmony get
				harmonic signals, Sky Mood Production come in my way like many other
				random events to find artists, but in time and accepting the first work
				I wish to publish, that is a tribute to freedom and life balance in a

				format, that can make some big difference to protect human rights. Not
				included in this album, but included in the prevision,

				who could make it happen, helping world wide

				itself in this life experience, and giving humanity the chance to create
				a

					>new perspective</a

				of freedom and duty to all, in a simple
