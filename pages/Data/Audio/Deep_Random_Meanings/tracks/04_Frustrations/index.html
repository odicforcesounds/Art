      We all need some frustration to reach better flows. <br>
      All dedicated work create frustractions. <br>
      They are just sensations that we need to live with. <br>
      But don't give up, you need to continue dreaming, so you can make something better <br> <br>
      In the ticking world of time's relentless sway,<br>
      A dance of frustration unfolds day by day.<br>
      Within this intricate web of seeking control,<br>
      Lies a quest to tame the current that sparks the soul.<br>

      Frustration, a tempest that brews within,<br>
      As moments slip by, like grains of sand in the wind.<br>
      In the labyrinthine corridors of discovery's path,<br>
      The pursuit of understanding, a trial with no aftermath.<br>

      The flickering glow of knowledge just out of reach,<br>
      A puzzle that taunts with lessons it will teach.<br>
      Oh, the yearning to unravel the enigmatic threads,<br>
      To grasp the secrets that lie dormant, like whispered words unsaid.<br>

      In the quest for dominion over electric might,<br>
      Impediments arise, casting shadows of blight.<br>
      Obstacles line the road, hurdles to overcome,<br>
      The intricate dance of progress, not easily won.<br>

      Through trial and error, the sparks may ignite,<br>
      Yet frustration lingers, a specter in the fight.<br>
      Complexities unfold with each passing phase,<br>
      Demanding patience and fortitude in relentless ways.<br>

      The ebb and flow of time's ceaseless tide,<br>
      As discoveries elude, frustration takes its stride.<br>
      But within this struggle, a fire still burns,<br>
      A determination that stubbornly yearns.<br>

      For in the throes of frustration's weary grip,<br>
      A beacon of resilience begins to equip.<br>
      A tenacious spirit that refuses to yield,<br>
      In the pursuit of understanding, an unyielding shield.<br>

      And so, frustration becomes a catalyst to grow,<br>
      A driving force, a relentless undertow.<br>
      With each setback endured, knowledge takes form,<br>
      As the elusive spark of electricity begins to transform.<br>

      In the intricate dance between frustration and delight,<br>
      A journey unfolds, unveiling insights bright.<br>
      For in the process of time's unyielding flow,<br>
      Simple truths are discovered, and wisdom begins to grow.
