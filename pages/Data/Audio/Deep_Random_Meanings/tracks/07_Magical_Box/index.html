    <p>
      In the world of the Chinese zodiac, a wondrous sight,<br>
      The Monkey, hailed as king, shines with radiant light.<br>
      Persons of the twelve signs, a consensus they find,<br>
      For the Monkey's wisdom and aid, all souls are aligned.<br>

      Once upon a time, a challenge arose,<br>
      A problem so daunting, it brought everyone's woes.<br>
      The zodiacs sought solutions, but none could prevail,<br>
      Until the Monkey stepped forth, with a clever tale.<br>

      With wit and cunning, he devised a plan,<br>
      To mend the broken bonds between every clan.<br>
      Using his agile mind and resourceful might,<br>
      The Monkey brought unity, shining through the night.<br>

      With a mischievous grin and a playful heart,<br>
      He brought laughter and joy, a healing art.<br>
      His actions spoke louder than words could convey,<br>
      As he turned sorrow into a joyous display.<br>

      The Rat and Ox, with gratitude in their eyes,<br>
      The Tiger and Rabbit, their spirits did rise.<br>
      The Dragon and Snake, in awe of his might,<br>
      The Horse and Sheep, basking in his light.<br>

      The Monkey's leadership, a beacon so bright,<br>
      Guiding them all towards harmony's height.<br>
      The Rooster and Dog, inspired by his ways,<br>
      The Pig, grateful for peaceful and prosperous days.<br>

      With each passing moment, the Monkey reigned,<br>
      As the king of all zodiacs, his title sustained.<br>
      His selfless acts of service, a testament true,<br>
      To the power of unity, and what love can do.<br>

      So let us honor the Monkey, wise and kind,<br>
      For his role as the king, in the hearts of humankind.<br>
      He taught us the value of working together,<br>
      To overcome challenges, now and forever.<br>

      In the kingdom of the zodiac, he'll forever stand,<br>
      The Monkey, the king, with an outstretched hand.<br>
      A symbol of hope, of friendship so grand,<br>
      United as one, in a harmonious land.
