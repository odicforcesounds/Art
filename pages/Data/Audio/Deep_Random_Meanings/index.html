        <p> We always try to run from <a href="./tracks/01_Darkness/index.html">Darkness</a> but we shouldn't. Darkness is Everything that we don't know, as the representation of all complexities dancing together in peace. That is <a href="./tracks/02_Helpful/index.html">Helpful</a>. That state of mind lead us to deal with many <a href="./tracks/04_Frustrations/index.html">Frustrations</a> while our thoughts can flow into it's own <a href="./tracks/05_Black_Hole/index.html">Hole</a> because we are focusing on our own thoughts, which is not a good idea because we can only choose which ones we want to feed in our <a href="./tracks/07_Magical_Box/index.html">Brain</a>. At least for Monkey, the way to escape from painful thoughts, is by <a href="./tracks/03_Beat_Flow/index.html">Dancing</a>, so Monkey can gain the sensations of <a href="./tracks/06_Perfection/index.html">Perfection</a>, since perfection is only a sequence of diferent states of conscience that somehow, they gently vanish from our attention, or just the result of finishing our hard work.
