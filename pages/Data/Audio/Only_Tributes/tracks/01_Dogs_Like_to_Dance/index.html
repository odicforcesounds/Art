				>Each human ( male or female ) have the same style in the "root" of
				their way of being the self. There are many who love to dance ( in many
				levels of interpretation of getting pleasure on what they like to do
				with their body ) and many others Love to watch, think and talk to their
				friends about it, and see what happen. Probably a good moment to create
				instability or even to solve problems. Well, but because we are in a
				logic world we all pass through both experiences, in time. Sometimes we
				are Cats, and other times we are Dogs. Maybe we cannot escape from being
				one or another, but at least I know why I love so much ( Cats and Dogs ) </p
			><br /><p
				>Note: There is a paint about dogs playing snooker. When I made this
				track, I imagine a little animation for it. The disco is full of dogs
				outside. Then they enter, go into the bar and start drinking... every
				dogs who enters the dance-floor, becomes a cat, and every Cat that
				leaves the dance-floor becomes a Dog. Just That :)
