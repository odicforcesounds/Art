				Tribute!
			</p>
			<p>Maybe a tribute to all the fans of this Movie!</p>

				>I feel like I am this guy who explode him self into a tower, but I do
				not approve that behavior! Is a contraditional way to judge and to
				express freedom! That example does not create a feeling of freedom! Not
				a single moment, but fear!Is always good to know we can be free from
				impositive systems. Most if we are not part of that behavior example. We
				Learn by examples not always by theory. Not only by their expressions,
				but because they learn from an example, learning is like teaching the
				process to care the same results we wish to teach. We all have the free
				choice to be free of any system. Is our choice to decide what kind of
				life style we wish to have. Naturally, each conditional life style, have
				many controversial conditions states. I think society is living good
				while is learning to love, because Not everyone learn it, because Not
				everyone suffer for it, if they desire to love. While the movie talk
				about how love can vanish, in that tragic compulsive need to express
				Change and find that his will is stronger than Love. While his
				egocentric decision that will care others decisions, destroy an historic
				building, a symbol of human history, which is art. A Sad story in fact,
				but since human history is full of those examples is a good movie! Since
				is good to teach the bad examples and to learn what we can learn from
				them. We learn not their historical expression. We Learn their
				historical results, which are in most cases, egocentric wills which do
				not care others perspectives. It means they dont ask! Asking is the step
				to learn, Not only theory, but reality. This realtity full of dreams!
				Full of illusions! Full of Creations! We Should teach how to care
				illusions, which care reality. While humanity spread those illusions
				made to not care. One side create a possible oposite. While I belive I
				made a wrong decision, It will give You an opportunity to find the right
				one! If I am wrong, is not bad at all, since is only information to care
				other choice!
