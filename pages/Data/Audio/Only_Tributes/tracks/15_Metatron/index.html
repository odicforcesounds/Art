      In ancient texts and mystic core,<br>
      Metatron emerges, forevermore.<br>
      Across the pages of sacred writ,<br>
      His essence shines, a celestial fit.<br>

      In Jewish mysticism, he takes his place,<br>
      As Enoch transformed, in heavenly grace.<br>
      From mortal prophet to angelic form,<br>
      Metatron, the divine bridge is born.<br>

      In the Book of Enoch, his tale takes flight,<br>
      Ascending to realms of heavenly light.<br>
      A guide and teacher, to Enoch bestowed,<br>
      Mysteries of creation he beautifully showed.<br>

      In the Talmud's teachings, his name resounds,<br>
      As a heavenly prince, wisdom abounds.<br>
      Metatron, the highest angel of all,<br>
      His presence upon us, like a celestial call.<br>

      The <a href="../../../Dao_Expression/tracks/08_Come_and_See_You_in_Me/index.html">Kabbalah</a>'s secrets he does unfold,<br>
      In sacred teachings, his wisdom is told.<br>
      With seventy-two names, his power's revealed,<br>
      Unlocking the mysteries that lie concealed.<br>

      In ancient scrolls and mystical verse,<br>
      Metatron's essence, we ardently immerse.<br>
      The celestial scribe, with knowledge vast,<br>
      Preserving truths, from the distant past.<br>

      He stands before the divine throne,<br>
      With fiery presence, all his own.<br>
      A mediator between heaven and earth,<br>
      Metatron's wisdom, of infinite worth.<br>

      Oh, Metatron, the angelic guide,<br>
      In sacred texts, you forever reside.<br>
      May we seek your wisdom, divine and true,<br>
      And find enlightenment, through and through.<br>

      Across the books, your name does shine,<br>
      Metatron, the angel, both human and divine.<br>
      Inscribed in tales of ancient yore,<br>
      Forever we'll seek you, forevermore.
