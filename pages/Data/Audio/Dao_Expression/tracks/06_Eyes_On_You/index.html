    <p>
      In the world where shadows dwell and secrets hide,<br>
      The Hermit roams, with wisdom as his guide.<br>
      Eyes piercing through the veil of murky night,<br>
      He seeks the truth, with unwavering sight.<br><br>

      Persons of the dance of darkness and the flickering light,<br>
      The Hermit wanders, driven by insight.<br>
      He treads a path that few dare to pursue,<br>
      Unearthing hidden truths, both old and new.<br><br>

      With lantern in hand, a beacon in the abyss,<br>
      He illuminates the mysteries that persist.<br>
      Through labyrinthine passages, he roams,<br>
      Seeking solace in the quiet of his own.<br><br>

      The Hermit's gaze, an unyielding stare,<br>
      Pierces through illusions, laying truths bare.<br>
      Within the depths of his introspective soul,<br>
      He finds the essence of self, his truest goal.<br><br>

      In the duality of Justice and Devil's reign,<br>
      The Hermit seeks harmony, a balance to maintain.<br>
      He understands the shadows that reside within,<br>
      Yet embraces the light, letting his soul begin.<br><br>

      Through trials and tribulations, he finds his way,<br>
      Navigating the worlds of night and day.<br>
      With steady steps, he charts his own course,<br>
      Guided by intuition, his inner voice the source.<br><br>

      In solitude, he finds strength to endure,<br>
      Embracing the mysteries that remain obscure.<br>
      Eyes fixed upon the truth, he walks with grace,<br>
      In the depths of his being, he finds his rightful place.<br><br>

      So, in the gaze of the Hermit, worlds collide,<br>
      Justice and Devil coexist, side by side.<br>
      Through introspection and unwavering gaze,<br>
      He unites their essence, in harmonious ways.<br><br>

      In the world of the Hermit, secrets unfurl,<br>
      A journey of self-discovery, a precious pearl.<br>
      With eyes on you, he sees beyond the mask,<br>
      Embracing the shadows, completing life's task.
