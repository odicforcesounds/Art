      Beneath the golden rays that bless the Earth,<br>
      A path unfolds, of ancient Sun's rebirth.<br>
      The Sun Keepers, guardians of celestial flame,<br>
      Embrace the cosmic dance, in honor of its name.<br>

      They walk the path where sunlit footprints tread,<br>
      Through worlds of light, where mysteries are spread.<br>
      Their souls alight with fiery passion's glow,<br>
      Unveiling secrets only the sun can show.<br>

      In temples ancient, they gather and commune,<br>
      Eyes turned skyward, basking in solar rune.<br>
      With hearts ablaze, they channel radiant might,<br>
      Harnessing sunbeams, igniting inner light.<br>

      Each step they take, a sacred solar dance,<br>
      Weaving cosmic threads in vibrant expanse.<br>
      They honor the sun's power, a sacred trust,<br>
      Nurturing its flame, in a world so unjust.<br>

      Through ancient rituals, they channel the sun's grace,<br>
      Inscribed upon their souls, its fiery embrace.<br>
      They carry wisdom born from ages past,<br>
      Guiding seekers to embrace their inner vast.<br>

      In solstice's glow, they celebrate with glee,<br>
      The sun's rebirth, a symbol of eternity.<br>
      They chant in harmony, invoking cosmic force,<br>
      Embracing solar energy as their divine source.<br>

      Through trials and tribulations, they remain,<br>
      Protectors of light, their purpose to sustain.<br>
      The path of the Sun Keepers, a radiant quest,<br>
      To shine their light, and bring the world its best.<br>

      So let us join them, in this sacred rite,<br>
      Walking the path of the sun's eternal light.<br>
      In unity and harmony, we'll forge our way,<br>
      As Sun Keepers, illuminating each new day.
