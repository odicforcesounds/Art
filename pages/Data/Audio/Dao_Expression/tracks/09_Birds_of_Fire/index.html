    <p>
      Birds of Fire, soaring high in the sky,<br>
      In their wings, the flames of passion lie.<br>
      Each feathered creature, a soul in flight,<br>
      Burning with purpose, radiant and bright.<br>

      Their wings, ablaze with dreams and desire,<br>
      They take flight, setting the world on fire.<br>
      With every beat, a rhythm of liberation,<br>
      Igniting hearts with boundless inspiration.<br>

      Like birds, they sing their unique songs,<br>
      Melodies of resilience, where strength belongs.<br>
      Their voices harmonize, creating a symphony,<br>
      A chorus of unity, in perfect harmony.<br>

      They navigate the winds of change,<br>
      With grace and courage, they rearrange.<br>
      Through adversity, their spirits rise,<br>
      Burning like embers, lighting up the skies.<br>

      Each bird, a flame of individuality,<br>
      Yet together, they form a party.<br>
      In their collective flight, they find power,<br>
      Unleashing their essence, hour by hour.<br>

      Their wingspan spans across the horizon,<br>
      Carrying hope, love, and dreams as they're arisen.<br>
      With every beat, a testament of their might,<br>
      Unveiling the world with their vibrant light.<br>

      Birds of Fire, messengers of the soul,<br>
      Their flight ignites a passion untold.<br>
      Through their existence, we're inspired,<br>
      To embrace our own flames, unexpired.<br>

      So let us soar with the Birds of Fire,<br>
      Unleashing our spirits, reaching higher.<br>
      For within us lies the same fiery spark,<br>
      Ready to blaze a trail, leaving our mark.
