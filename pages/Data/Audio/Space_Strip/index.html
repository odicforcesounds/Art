				Space Trip Abum, is about the real description, of time and space,
				related to my space zone, but mostly related to the spiritual connection
				that the world is living into. Identified by many as Devil, the one who
				create and maintain humanity conscience balance, was the one who was out
				of balance, even with his own chaotic and harmony condition to survive
				in many life form conditions. This Angel many times represented by the
				one who control total darkness, is an old friend, and more than
				anything, he knows how important is my call. He will not help, but he
				will not prevent. He is getting pleasure in everything, the good and the

				at the same time, as this abstract categories are created by each self
				too. My message and my mission is to talk to each self that is Evil and
				to all who support their will. Even with all control they have in this
				reality, there is always time
