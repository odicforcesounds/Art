      Solipsism, as you may know, suggests a "perfect" state for creativity. However, this theory's denial of others' existence is false, for I am certain that you exist, even if I do not fully comprehend it. When we engage in creative work alone, we encounter fewer obstacles, enabling us to manifest our vision as desired. Individualism, rather than being a choice, is an inherent condition that applies to all of us in real-time. While we depend on others for various aspects of our lives, our speech, whether in the presence of others or not, reflects our individual interpretations. Love, reason, fairness, faith, friendship, pain, art, music, literature, and more—all our opinions are shaped by our personal experiences, choices, and memories. Each of us possesses our unique interpretation, perspective, beliefs, and life experiences.

      "Truth" finds expression within the framework of time, as it is our individual perception of time that defines our truth. This truth is a culmination of our fragmented perceptions and expressions, constructing our individual interpretation of what is true. It exists alongside other interpretations of truth, each interconnected in a harmonious relationship. From Buddhism to Christianity, theism to atheism, and even within the worlds of science, all individuals live within their own unique learning conditions, conscientiously interpreting and explaining reality. It is not incorrect to state that everyone lives in a condition where their truth may be flawed or incomplete (solipsism-individualistic). This diversity of perspectives explains the myriad expressions surrounding similar or even identical subjects. It is through this multitude of viewpoints that we recognize the intelligence of humanity, for it is our innate creativity that allows us to embrace new perspectives.

      While it is incorrect to declare one's viewpoint as the absolute truth, it is not wrong to assert that one's expression of truth is absolute, recognizing that it encompasses the acceptance of errors as part of this truth. This acceptance encompasses all influences that may impact our truth but are not intrinsic to it. Above all, it is crucial to understand that truth is transient, fluctuating with the passage of time. Truth serves as a description of precision, rather than an expression of reality. When an event occurs and is precisely described within a specific timeframe, it can be considered true, for it exists within a framework that we cannot deny.

      Based on this understanding, we all live within a solipsistic condition, emphasizing the importance of refraining from imposing our truth upon others.
