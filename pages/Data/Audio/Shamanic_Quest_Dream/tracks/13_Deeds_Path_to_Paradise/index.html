      In the world of Buddhism's sacred core,<br>
      Lies wisdom profound, ancient and pure,<br>
      A party of teachings, serene and wise,<br>
      Guiding seekers on the path to paradise.<br>

      With deeds as their compass, they tread the way,<br>
      Seeking liberation, come what may,<br>
      Each action a ripple in the cosmic sea,<br>
      Shaping their destiny, setting spirits free.<br>

      The path unfurls with every gentle stride,<br>
      Revealing truths that cannot be denied,<br>
      For in the deeds they sow along life's course,<br>
      Reside the keys to unlock inner source.<br>

      Compassion blooms like a fragrant flower,<br>
      Kindness extending its soothing power,<br>
      For in the giving, they find their grace,<br>
      Illuminating the darkness, leaving no trace.<br>

      Generosity flows like a sacred stream,<br>
      Sharing abundance, a heavenly gleam,<br>
      For in the sharing, they realize,<br>
      The interconnectedness that underlies.<br>

      Patience, a virtue to cultivate and grow,<br>
      Nurturing seeds, allowing them to show,<br>
      For in the waiting, they learn to embrace,<br>
      The beauty of life's unfolding pace.<br>

      Ethics and virtue, their moral guide,<br>
      A compass true, in this human tide,<br>
      For in right conduct, they find release,<br>
      From suffering's grasp, a pathway to peace.<br>

      Wisdom's light illuminates their way,<br>
      Discerning truth, dispelling the grey,<br>
      For in the seeking, they come to see,<br>
      The nature of reality, pure and free.<br>

      With every step, they journey within,<br>
      Transforming darkness, releasing the din,<br>
      For in the deeds they sow along their quest,<br>
      Lies the path to paradise, eternal rest.<br>

      So let us heed the lessons they impart,<br>
      With deeds of love etched upon our heart,<br>
      For in the choices we make each day,<br>
      Lies the path to paradise, just a step away.
