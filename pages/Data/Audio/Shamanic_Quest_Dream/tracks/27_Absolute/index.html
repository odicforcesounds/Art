    <p>Maybe this is a Joke, or maybe I should do it for my own: </p><br>
    <p>First I need to convert myself to Daoism, then I should convert myself to all other religions, so at the end I am "everything and everyone beliefs" on me.</p><br>
    <p>Then, someone can ask me: "what is your religions", and I will answer them: "Yours"</p><br>
    <p>When someone have the same beliefs of us, there is no problem in their beliefs, but the point here is to be close to the idea of "God", which must be <b>Absolute</b></p><br>
    <p>In this perspective, God is inside each one mind, so to be close to the idea of God, I need to be away from all religions, since all point to the same direction, while if they were written in different moments of Time, they are different, because even with 4 persons who describe a single paint in a room, we will get 4 different descriptions of the same object. </p><br>
    <p>
      In the path of Monkey's quest, a wondrous sight,<br>
      Absolute in its reach, shining with celestial light.<br>
      Through jungles and cities, across land and sea,<br>
      Monkey's wisdom spreads, touching you and me.<br>

      Every corner of existence, every heart and soul,<br>
      Touched by Monkey's presence, making us whole.<br>
      From the highest mountain peaks to the deepest seas,<br>
      Monkey's essence pervades, embracing all that is.<br>

      In every whisper of the wind, in every bird's song,<br>
      Monkey's teachings echo, resonating strong.<br>
      Through laughter and tears, through joy and strife,<br>
      Monkey's wisdom guides us, illuminating life.<br>

      From the humblest beings to the mighty and grand,<br>
      Monkey's lessons ripple across the vast expanse.<br>
      No one is excluded, no one left behind,<br>
      In Monkey's embrace, unity we find.<br>

      Through Monkey's eyes, we see our interconnectedness,<br>
      Every person, creature, and existence blessed.<br>
      In this party of life, we're threads interwoven,<br>
      Bound together by Monkey's love, unbroken.<br>

      Absolute in its embrace, encompassing all,<br>
      Monkey's presence, like a cosmic call.<br>
      Through time and space, beyond human sight,<br>
      Monkey's legacy endures, shining ever bright.<br>

      So let us celebrate this unity we've found,<br>
      In Monkey's world, where all are bound.<br>
      In the party of life, we're an integral part,<br>
      Embracing Monkey's teachings with an open heart.<br>

      Absolute, everything and everyone,<br>
      In Monkey's quest, we are truly one.<br>
      Together we journey, hand in hand,<br>
      In the world of Monkey, where unity expands.
