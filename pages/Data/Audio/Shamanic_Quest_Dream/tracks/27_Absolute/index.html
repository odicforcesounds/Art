    <p>Maybe this is a Joke, or maybe I should do it for my own: </p><br>
    <p>First I need to convert myself to Daoism, then I should convert myself to all other religions, so at the end I am "everything and everyone beliefs" on me.</p><br>
    <p>Then, someone can ask me: "what is your religions", and I will answer them: "Yours"</p><br>
    <p>When someone have the same beliefs of us, there is no problem in their beliefs, but the point here is to be close to the idea of "God", which must be <b>Absolute</b></p><br>
    <p>In this perspective, God is inside each one mind, so to be close to the idea of God, I need to be away from all religions, since all point to the same direction, while if they were written in different moments of Time, they are different, because even with 4 persons who describe a single paint in a room, we will get 4 different descriptions of the same object, while nothing is so original as we may think, knowledge just grow in Time to talk about what we "already know".
