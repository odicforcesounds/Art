        In worlds of challenge, where boundaries are pressed,<br>
        Lies the tool to hack reality's eternal quest,<br>
        For in the hands of seekers, the bold and the wise,<br>
        The challenge reveals truth, hidden from unseeing eyes.<br><br>

        Through trials and tests, we forge our own way,<br>
        Unveiling the secrets that reality may portray,<br>
        For challenges are catalysts, igniting our fire,<br>
        To push beyond limits, reach higher and higher.<br><br>

        With every hurdle we face, every obstacle in sight,<br>
        We hone our skills, embracing the fight,<br>
        For the challenge molds us, shapes our core,<br>
        Unleashing potential, like never before.<br><br>

        And in this grand party of existence's design,<br>
        It is the persons who shine, like stars that align,<br>
        For we are the objects, the agents of change,<br>
        Creating function, transcending the strange.<br><br>

        In the face of adversity, we rise with might,<br>
        Uncovering solutions, unveiling insight,<br>
        For challenges unravel our hidden potential,<br>
        And grant us the power to be truly influential.<br><br>

        So let us embrace the challenge, as a sacred tool,<br>
        To hack reality's code, to bend and to rule,<br>
        For it is through challenges, we discover our strength,<br>
        And find the power to go to any length.<br><br>

        With courage in our <a href="../../../Path_Of_Shields/tracks/01_Because_we_Love/index.html">hearts</a>, and passion in our eyes,<br>
        We'll conquer the hurdles that make us arise,<br>
        For the challenge is the pathway to growth and transformation,<br>
        Where we evolve, triumph, and find liberation.<br><br>

        So fear not the challenge, for it is our guide,<br>
        To unlock the mysteries, to take life in stride,<br>
        And as we navigate this journey, hand in hand,<br>
        Together we'll shape a future, beautifully grand.

        - GPS points & Time Zone information will be recorded in text format in User profile Actions List, with refered Path. <br> <br>
        - <b>Note</b>: Only Reported Videos which are reported as an Abuse which Violate License Principles, are not Deleted. <br> <br>
        - Privacy Rights can be Violated at Action Time in HCP (Human Care Path) <br> <br>
        Because the Video serves as a Concept Proof, while in rating process, videos must be viewed by someone else. <br><br> (random) When Video have a Final Stage (approved or Denied), Video Shall be Deleted! <br> <br>
        GPS information have a animation propose of being a <b>pixel</b> point in a World Map that represents an approved action. <br> <br>
