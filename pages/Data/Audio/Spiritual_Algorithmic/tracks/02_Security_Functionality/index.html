    <p>
      In a world where concerns for security reside,<br>
      Let me take you on a poetic ride,<br>
      To show you why functionality holds the key,<br>
      And why we don't need security obsessively.<br>

      In this digital age of endless innovation,<br>
      Where technology sweeps us with fascination,<br>
      We often hear the call for heightened security,<br>
      To protect our data, preserve confidentiality.<br>

      But let me paint a picture, if I may,<br>
      Of a world where functionality holds sway,<br>
      Where seamless experiences and ease of use,<br>
      Take priority, without security abuse.<br>

      For what good is security, if it hinders our stride,<br>
      If it shackles us, restricts us, and divides,<br>
      Functionality, on the other hand, empowers,<br>
      Enabling us to reach greater heights and towers.<br>

      Imagine a world where systems flow,<br>
      Where efficiency and productivity glow,<br>
      Where innovations thrive and ideas bloom,<br>
      Without being constrained in a security tomb.<br>

      Let us not forget, security has its place,<br>
      But functionality brings progress and grace,<br>
      It fuels our endeavors, unleashes our might,<br>
      And propels us forward, to embrace the light.<br>

      For it is through functionality that we evolve,<br>
      That we solve problems and our fears dissolve,<br>
      It encourages collaboration and seamless integration,<br>
      To build a <a href="../../../Shiva_and_Kali_Dance/tracks/19_Human_Paradox_New_World/index.html">world</a> of endless innovation.<br>

      So let us seek a balance, a harmonious blend,<br>
      Where functionality and security extend,<br>
      Hand in hand, they work in perfect unity,<br>
      Creating a world that is safe and free.<br>

      So, my friend, let me impart to you,<br>
      That in this quest for a digital breakthrough,<br>
      We don't need security to suffocate our ability,<br>
      But rather, functionality to foster our agility.<br>

      Embrace the power of functionality's flight,<br>
      And watch as innovation takes its glorious height,<br>
      For in this digital world, it is clear to see,<br>
      That functionality reigns supreme, setting us free.
