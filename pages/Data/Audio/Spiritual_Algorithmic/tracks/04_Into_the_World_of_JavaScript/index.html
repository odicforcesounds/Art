				Internet is the World of Java and Script, meaning, HTML, CSS and
				JavaScript. But others technologies can do the same, while is only HTML
				and CSS, JavaScript is the most popular language used to manipulate any
				static content of any webpage. At the same time, is a "way" to connect
				to everyone! Share Knowledge. ( the Most value things of humanity -
				Rational Knowledge with a bit of sensitivity ( humanity ) )

				Naturally I wish to thanks to all contribution in the world that fix any
				code that any other coder did as a mistake, in the world where we mostly
				learn by our own mistakes. To (

				) is to
				<a href="../../../Eternal_Delay/tracks/05_Human_Test_Sent/index.html"
					>test</a

				, and the process of testing is the only way to undestand the result,
				while testing sometimes is not good, in the sense of if the target is a
				living being. I like to test the brain capability in how each can
				imagine any description. I think is enought to test anything else.

				) we are alive, and have an expression of Life, by the same condition,
				(there is electricity in my body like my brain needs electricity to
				process information) I am trying to find some help to code my "solution"
				the way I designed, not in the way the Dragon already apply to their own
				in reality. The Dragon didn't fail. He is already living in a world of
				control. I don't like that paranoid control he is living, but the way I
				defined. Is different. I wish to be Big in the Business Area, since the
				Dragon believe I am a good sign for business, maybe my definition is
				better for ( non-dragon lands ), as is not about a full-time control
				system, but a relaxed system, ( more or less what we have now ) but
				caring individual choices, that can be represent as a good choice, in
				the common sense of "many", have value, while knowledge it self, have
				value as well. We search the internet to gain knowledge, we process
				knowledge, we memorize knowledge, so one day we become the expression of
				knowledge in reality, or at least, we find the solution in
