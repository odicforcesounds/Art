    <p>
      In the depths of my being, a tempest brews,<br>
      A whirlwind of emotions, I cannot refuse.<br>
      What is going on with me, I cannot stop,<br>
      A dance of chaos, an internal hilltop.<br><br>

      Like a flame that flickers, never to cease,<br>
      I'm caught in a whirlpool, seeking release.<br>
      A maelstrom of thoughts, swirling inside,<br>
      A turbulent journey, I cannot hide.<br><br>

      Restless winds carry my worries and fears,<br>
      Tossing and turning, like the tides that veer.<br>
      What is going on with me, I cannot deny,<br>
      This relentless storm, beneath the sky.<br><br>

      A surge of emotions, like waves crashing near,<br>
      They engulf my heart, they whisper in my ear.<br>
      Yearning for answers, seeking solace deep,<br>
      In this whirlwind of chaos, I yearn for sleep.<br><br>

      Yet amidst the tumult, a glimmer I see,<br>
      A chance for growth, a chance to be free.<br>
      For in the storm's eye, lies clarity's call,<br>
      To embrace the chaos, and rise above it all.<br><br>

      Through the winds of confusion, I'll find my way,<br>
      With resilience and strength, I'll face the fray.<br>
      For within me lies the power to mend,<br>
      To find serenity, and on myself depend.<br><br>

      So, I'll navigate this tempest, with courage in tow,<br>
      Embracing the uncertainty, as I continue to grow.<br>
      What is going on with me, I'll soon understand,<br>
      For within this journey, lies the strength to withstand.<br><br>

      And when the storm subsides, and calmness prevails,<br>
      I'll emerge stronger, with wisdom that never fails.<br>
      For it is in the chaos, where transformation lies,<br>
      A testament to the spirit that forever flies.
