      In a bustling town, under the starry night sky,<br>
      A grand celebration fills the air, spirits flying high.<br>
      A community united, hearts beating as one,<br>
      They gather together, their journey just begun.<br>

      Persons of the laughter and cheers, a figure stands tall,<br>
      The one they call their guide, their savior, their all.<br>
      With trust in their eyes, they look to him with grace,<br>
      Eager to follow, to explore an unknown place.<br>

      He, the chosen one, led by a divine decree,<br>
      Embarks on a path, a destination yet to see.<br>
      The crowd dances and swirls, their excitement ablaze,<br>
      A collective yearning, a thirst for uncharted days.<br>

      Together they venture, through the night they roam,<br>
      Leaving behind the familiar, creating a new home.<br>
      In unison they step, with hopes held high,<br>
      With their guiding light, they reach for the sky.<br>

      The journey unfolds, mysteries awaiting discovery,<br>
      As they walk hand in hand, forging their own story.<br>
      With every step, the bonds between them grow strong,<br>
      For in unity they find solace, a sense of belonging.<br>

      Through winding roads and uncharted trails they tread,<br>
      Their faith unwavering, no obstacle left unsaid.<br>
      For in this grand adventure, they find purpose anew,<br>
      Embracing the unknown, their spirits ever true.<br>

      As the night deepens and stars illuminate the way,<br>
      They revel in the joy, embracing the unknown sway.<br>
      With hearts combined, they embark on this quest,<br>
      Led by their chosen one, to a destiny that's best.<br>

      So let the music play, let the celebration ensue,<br>
      In this grand community party, dreams come true.<br>
      With their <a href="../../../The_Unpredictable_Change/tracks/07_God_pay_for_Love/index.html">god</a> as their guide, they dance into the night,<br>
      Bound together forever, in love's eternal light.
