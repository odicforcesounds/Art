    <p>Tribute to <b>Anonymous</b>
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Sometimes I think that this groups didn't like this track. <br> Maybe they don't understand the meaning. <br> At least I hope
      someday they will know, that even if there is some good activities associated to Anonymous, there are the bad. Like everything else that is based on that propriety called <a href="../../../Only_Tributes/tracks/08_V_Euclidean_Space/index.html">V</a>.<br> Revange doesn't solve problems, they are just an <b>echo replay</b>. That is what they do, normally. <br> I <a href="../../../Deep_Random_Meanings/tracks/02_Helpful/index.html">hope</a> they understand that, they need to have <a href="../../../Emotional_Signals/tracks/10_The_Game_Project/index.html">fun</a> to do what ever they like to do, to explain the reason of doing the same! <a href="../../../Emotional_Signals/tracks/12_Hacking_Festival/index.html">Addiction to Repetition</a>! <br> I Know that simple joke that say's: "You are not able to Win the <a href="../../../Machine_World/tracks/01_Storming_Plan_Enigmatic_War/index.html">Storm</a>", and that person, somewhere in Time say: <a href="../../../The_Long_Road/tracks/08_I_am_Music/index.html">I am</a> the Storm". It is a joke, because to win the storm you need to leave it away, or else the storm take you with "her". <br> You probably already know that, because You know, that no one could Win the <b>Air</b>, the <b>Wind</b>, the <b>Rain</b>, the <b>Land</b> or the <b>Sea</b>, and they will be there, for eternity! And I will repeat myself again. I only ask a <a href="../../../Shiva_and_Kali_Dance/tracks/08_First_Contact_Path_of_Shields/index.html">Path of Shields</a>!
