    <p>
      In the world of thoughts, I am free,<br>
      Not defined by labels, but inquisitive, you see.<br>
      No celebration of purification in my life's parade,<br>
      As a child, I spoke to dogs, stones, birds, and jade.<br><br>

      Conversations with myself, actions I undertake,<br>
      As billions of humans do, a common thread we make.<br>
      And birds, dogs, and cats, I believe they do the same,<br>
      For even stones have their own existence to claim.<br><br>

      Logic prevails, a path both theist and I may tread,<br>
      Accepting expressions of gods, their stories widespread.<br>
      In that sense, perhaps we all are pagans, you see,<br>
      Embracing the divine in each unique deity.<br><br>

      The sun, a star, binds us in a celestial dance,<br>
      A link between our existence and cosmic expanse.<br>
      As a function, it creates the conditions we adore,<br>
      Divine in its functionality, forevermore.<br><br>

      Survival doesn't hinge on the sun's warming embrace,<br>
      Yet its presence shapes our lives, a vital space.<br>
      In a romantic notion, through logic's lens we perceive,<br>
      The sun's divinity, a truth we can't conceive.<br><br>

      Pagan or atheist, labels fade in love's embrace,<br>
      What truly matters is the affection we chase.<br>
      For in the end, it's love that makes us whole,<br>
      Connecting hearts, enriching every soul.<br><br>

      So let us embrace the cult of the sun's warm glow,<br>
      In awe of its presence, its eternal show.<br>
      As the monkey, I urge love to be our guide,<br>
      In the world of paganism, let compassion reside.<br>
