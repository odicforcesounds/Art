				<b>Noise Frequency - Impulse</b> is about myself in this act of courage
				to try to make what destiny gave me without the possibility to deny. Is
				about my fears, my madness in a conscience process of what was the real
				risk. Is about how I deal with this dream, how I deal with the message’s
				and how I deal with all this signals that are strange and new to me.
