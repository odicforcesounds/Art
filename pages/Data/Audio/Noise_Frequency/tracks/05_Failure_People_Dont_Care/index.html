    <p>
      Failure, a bitter taste upon the lips,<br>
      A haunting shadow, where hope slowly slips.<br>
      In the world of dreams, where ambitions collide,<br>
      People turn a blind eye, their apathy can't hide.<br>

      Oh, the depths of failure, how it stings the soul,<br>
      Yet people pass by, indifferent and cold.<br>
      They avert their gaze, feigning ignorance so rare,<br>
      Failure's cries fall on deaf ears, a burden hard to bear.<br>

      The weight of shattered dreams, burdensome and heavy,<br>
      But the indifference of others, a blow so steady.<br>
      They walk on, unaffected by another's plight,<br>
      Failure's cries drowned in the silence of the night.<br>

      Oh, the cruelty of indifference, a heart devoid of care,<br>
      As failure's wounds deepen, festering in despair.<br>
      They mock and jest, casting judgment from their throne,<br>
      Unaware of the pain, the struggle that's unknown.<br>

      Failure, a harsh companion, a constant bitter foe,<br>
      Yet people don't care, their empathy does not show.<br>
      They pass by, wrapped in their own self-centered schemes,<br>
      Leaving failure to suffer alone, lost in shattered dreams.<br>

      So let us be mindful, and open our hearts wide,<br>
      To those who stumble and fall, their dreams cast aside.<br>
      For in the face of failure, compassion can repair,<br>
      A world where people care, where empathy is our shared prayer.
