      In the depths of self-discovery, where the shadows fade away,<br>
      A soul stands tall and fearless, in the light of a brand-new day.<br>
      "I know myself," proclaims the free, unbound by doubt or fear,<br>
      Embracing truth and authenticity, their essence crystal clear.<br>

      With introspection as their guide, they journeyed deep within,<br>
      Exploring hidden chambers, where their truest self had been.<br>
      They shed the masks of illusion, and embraced their purest form,<br>
      A free spirit unencumbered, a soul reborn.<br>

      No longer bound by expectations, nor swayed by others' views,<br>
      They danced to their own rhythm, and followed their own cues.<br>
      For in the vast expanse of being, they found their sovereign reign,<br>
      A free man, untethered, liberated from the chains.<br>

      With every step they took, they owned their authentic voice,<br>
      Honoring their dreams and passions, making their own choice.<br>
      They reveled in their uniqueness, in the party they wove,<br>
      A masterpiece of self-expression, a life they freely strove.<br>

      "I am a free man," they declared, their spirit soaring high,<br>
      Unshackled from conformity, reaching for the sky.<br>
      With every breath they took, they drank the nectar of their soul,<br>
      Embracing life's vast party, embracing the unknown.<br>

      So let us celebrate their journey, as they navigate life's seas,<br>
      With unwavering self-awareness, and an essence set to seize.<br>
      For in knowing oneself, in claiming freedom's sacred art,<br>
      They inspire others to awaken and listen to their own heart.
