    <p>
      In ancient tales of Japan, a story is told,<br>
      Of the Three Wise Monkeys, wise and bold.<br>
      See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil they say,<br>
      Guiding us through life, in their own special way.<br>

      The first monkey, with hands upon its eyes,<br>
      <a href="../../../Path_Of_Shields/tracks/12_DoD/index.html">See</a> No Evil, it whispers with a sigh.<br>
      It teaches us to turn away from darkness and strife,<br>
      To focus on goodness and the beauty of life.<br>

      The second monkey, with hands by its ears,<br>
      <a href="../../../Signals_of_Time/tracks/09_Save_Your_Sanity/index.html">Hear</a> No Evil, its message crystal clear.<br>
      It reminds us to filter out negativity's sound,<br>
      And listen to the whispers of peace all around.<br>

      The third monkey, with hands on its mouth,<br>
      <b>Speak</b> No Evil, it proclaims from the south.<br>
      It guides us to be mindful of the words we convey,<br>
      To spread kindness and love, in every word we say.<br>

      Together, these monkeys form a sacred trio,<br>
      With wisdom and guidance that eternally flow.<br>
      Their teachings, profound, in their simplicity,<br>
      Remind us of values held universally.<br>

      For in a world filled with chaos and noise,<br>
      The Three Wise Monkeys offer their poise.<br>
      They show us the path to a virtuous way,<br>
      Guiding our steps, day after day.<br>

      In their presence, we find solace and peace,<br>
      Their teachings, like a gentle breeze.<br>
      So let us embody their wisdom and grace,<br>
      As we navigate life's intricate maze.<br>

      See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil, they preach,<br>
      A lesson of harmony, within our reach.<br>
      Embrace their teachings, with an open heart,<br>
      And let their wisdom be a guiding art.
