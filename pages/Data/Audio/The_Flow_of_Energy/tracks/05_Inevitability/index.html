    <p>
      In the vast expanse of existence's sway,<br>
      Lies a current that guides us along the way,<br>
      The flow of inevitability, steadfast and true,<br>
      Unveiling destinies, no matter what we pursue.<br>

      Like a mighty river, it courses through time,<br>
      Carving pathways where our fates combine.<br>
      Through twists and turns, it weaves its design,<br>
      Nudging us forward, in its relentless rhyme.<br>

      In every moment, its presence persists,<br>
      A force we can't escape, no matter the twists.<br>
      It binds us to the cosmic concert's thread,<br>
      A dance with destiny, where we're led.<br>

      In the embrace of inevitability's might,<br>
      We encounter trials, both dark and bright.<br>
      Challenges and triumphs, woven in its embrace,<br>
      Shaping our stories, leaving a trace.<br>

      From the first breath to our final sigh,<br>
      Inevitability weaves the moments that fly.<br>
      Birth and death, joy and sorrow,<br>
      Connected by threads we can't borrow.<br>

      Choices we make, and paths we traverse,<br>
      Are connected with the flow, for better or worse.<br>
      No matter the struggle, no matter the strife,<br>
      Inevitability holds the rhythm of life.<br>

      It whispers in the wind, sings in the rain,<br>
      Guiding us through pleasure and through pain.<br>
      In the concert of time, it paints its stroke,<br>
      Reminding us that nothing is a mere joke.<br>

      Yet, within its current, we find our own power,<br>
      To shape our destiny, in each passing hour.<br>
      For while inevitability may set the stage,<br>
      We hold the pen to write our own page.<br>

      So embrace the flow, with an open heart,<br>
      Discover its secrets, play your unique part.<br>
      For in the dance of inevitability's tide,<br>
      We find the beauty of life, where our souls abide.
