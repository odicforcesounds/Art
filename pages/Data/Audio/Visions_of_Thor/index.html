            The first album is in fact about <a href="../../../Visions//index.html">my Dream</a>, which is represented
            simbolicly by <span style="color:orange">Thor</span>, the one who have the first perception of what was really happening.
            Since <a href="../Eternal_Delay/tracks/07_Light_Interception/index.html">Odin</a> demands <span style="color:orange">Thor</span> to send is Hammer to produce Light,
            and since Odin is the one who intercept the change in the non-space zone,  
            they saw <span style="color:yellow">Buddha</span> falling into the Vibrational Zone ( Ours ) and they listen
  <span style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> translation about 
            <span style="color:yellow">Buddha</span> words (<span
              style="color:red">Out of Compassion for Me, don’t Destroy my Gifts</span>)
            which is represented as a
            <a href="./tracks/03_Pain_vs_Love/index.html">Love and Pain</a> letter between <span style="color:yellow">Buddha</span> and <span style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span>
            with the title
            <a href="./tracks/05_Burned_in_the_Hands_of_Wind/index.html">"Burned in the Hands of Wind - Noisy Silence"</a>.
            Because I am the one who get <span
              style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> information’s about many things
            related to this story you are reading, while it is about a simple dream,
            I had the need to be included not only as "God/s" voice (will/desire), but as a single human too, telling the world that 
            <a href="./tracks/11_We_are_the_Ones/index.html">We are the Ones</a>,
            since all information sent by <span
              style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> itself in form of signals and vibrations, which is represented by Shiva
            <a href="./tracks/10_Shake_My_Snakes/index.html">Snakes</a>, You may see and listen, if you can feel, and if you understand your emotions.
            The key to understand <span style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> signals is in our 
            <a href="./tracks/08_Invisible_Frequency/index.html">Invisible
              Frequency</a>, that Everyone can <a href="../Tao_Expression/tracks/06_Eyes_On_You/index.html">READ</a> and <a
              href="../Path_Of_Shields/tracks/16_Can_Feel_Have_Body/index.html">FEEL</a>, which in my case is in fact a way to represent a must change, 
            my own change, <a href="../The_Long_Road/tracks/05_We_Must_Change_Our_Ways/index.html">everyone
              else change</a>, my own behavior, everyone else behaviors, giving to
            everyone a constant
            <a href="./tracks/01/index.html">Internal Spiritual Upgrade</a>, to have
            a method to detect where is the <span style="color:red"><a href="./tracks/09_Magnata_Evil_Inside/index.html">Evil</a></span>
            in me, in you, in this reality. 
            The main mission I have is to target the
            <a href="./tracks/07_V_Euclidean_Space/index.html">World</a>, so all can pay attention to my <a href="https://wiki.odicforcesounds.com">human care key solution</a>,
            that is inside of the will of each who Love the sense of 
            <a href="./tracks/02_Water_Horses_Woman_Freedom/index.html">Freedom</a>, and have the desire to share it with everyone!
