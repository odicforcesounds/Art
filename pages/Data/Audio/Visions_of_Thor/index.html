				The first album is in fact about
				<a href="../../../Visions/index.html">my Dream</a>, which is represented
				simbolicly by <span style="color: orange">Thor</span>, the one who have
				the first perception of what was really happening, since
				<a href="../Eternal_Delay/tracks/07_Light_Interception/index.html"
					>Odin</a
				>
				demands <span style="color: orange">Thor</span> to send is Hammer to
				produce Light, while Odin is the one who intercept the change in the
				non-space zone, they saw
				<span style="color: yellow">Buddha</span> falling into the Vibrational
				Zone ( Ours ) and they listen
				<span style="color: greenyellow">Shiva</span> translation about
				<span style="color: yellow">Buddha</span> words (<span
					style="color: red"
					>Out of Compassion for Me, don’t Destroy my Gifts</span
				>) which is represented as a
				<a href="./tracks/03_Pain_vs_Love/index.html">Love and Pain</a> letter
				between <span style="color: yellow">Buddha</span> and
				<span style="color: greenyellow">Shiva</span>
				with the title
				<a href="./tracks/05_Burned_in_the_Hands_of_Wind/index.html"
					>"Burned in the Hands of Wind - Noisy Silence"</a
				>. Because I am the one who get
				<span style="color: greenyellow">Shiva</span> information’s about many
				things related to this story you are reading, while it is about a simple
				dream, I had the need to be included not only as "God/s" voice
				(will/desire), but as a single human too, telling the world that
				<a href="./tracks/11_We_are_the_Ones/index.html">We are the Ones</a>,
				since all information sent by
				<span style="color: greenyellow">Shiva</span> itselfi, are in form of
				signals and
				<a href="./tracks/08_Invisible_Frequency/index.html">Vibrations</a>,
				which is represented by Shiva
				<a href="./tracks/10_Shake_My_Snakes/index.html">Snakes</a>. You may see
				and listen, if you can feel, and if you understand your emotions. The
				key to understand <span style="color: greenyellow">Shiva</span> signals
				is in our
				<a href="./tracks/08_Invisible_Frequency/index.html"
					>Invisible Frequency</a
				>, that Everyone can
				<a href="../Tao_Expression/tracks/06_Eyes_On_You/index.html">READ</a>
				and
				<a href="../Path_Of_Shields/tracks/16_Can_Feel_Have_Body/index.html"
					>FEEL</a
				>, which in my case is in fact a way to represent a must change, my own
				change,
				<a href="../The_Long_Road/tracks/05_We_Must_Change_Our_Ways/index.html"
					>everyone else change</a
				>, my own behavior, everyone else behaviors, giving to everyone a
				constant
				<a href="./tracks/01_Emerge_Internal_Upgrade/index.html"
					>Internal Spiritual Upgrade</a
				>, to have a method to detect where is the
				<span style="color: red"
					><a href="./tracks/09_Magnata_Evil_Inside/index.html">Evil</a></span
				>
				in me, in you, in this reality. The main mission I have is to target the
				<a href="./tracks/07_V_Euclidean_Space/index.html">World</a>, so all can
				pay attention to my
				<a href="https://wiki.odicforcesounds.com" rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>human care key solution</a
				>, that is inside of the will of each who Love the sense of
				<a href="./tracks/02_Water_Horses_Woman_Freedom/index.html">Freedom</a>,
				and have the desire to share it with everyone!
