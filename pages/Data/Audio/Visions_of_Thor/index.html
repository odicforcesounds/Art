            The first album is in fact about <a href="../../../Visions//index.html">my dream</a>, which is represented
            simbolicly by <span style="color:orange">Thor</span>, the one who have the first vision of what was really happening.
            As <span style="color:orange">Thor</span> was who was sending light with
            his Hammer, he is the first one who see.
            He saw <span style="color:yellow">Buddha</span> falling and he listen
  <span style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> translation about 
            <span style="color:yellow">Buddha</span> words (<span
              style="color:red">Out of Compassion for Me, don’t Destroy my Gifts</span>)
            which is represented as a
            <a href="./tracks/03_Pain_vs_Love/index.html">Love and Pain</a> letter between <span style="color:yellow">Buddha</span> and <span style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> with the title “
            <a href="./tracks/05_Burned_in_the_Hands_of_Wind/index.html">Burned in the Hands of Wind - Noisy Silence</a>“.
            Because I am the one who get <span
              style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> information’s about many things
            related to this story you are reading, while it is about a simple dream,
            I had the need to be included not only "God/s" voice (will/desire), but as a single human too, telling the world that “
            <a href="./tracks/11_We_are_the_Ones/index.html">We are the Ones</a>“,
            since all information sent by <span
              style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> itself in form of signals and vibrations, are related to his
            <a href="./tracks/10_Shake_My_Snakes/index.html">Snakes</a>.
            The key to understand <span style="color:greenyellow">Shiva</span> signals was in a
            <a href="./tracks/08_Invisible_Frequency/index.html">Invisible
              Frequency</a>, that represent a must change, my own change, everyone
            else change, my own behavior, everyone else behaviors, giving to
            everyone a constant
            <a href="./tracks/01/index.html">Internal Spiritual Upgrade</a>, to have
            a method to detect where is the <span style="color:red"><a href="./tracks/09_Magnata_Evil_Inside/index.html">Evil</a></span> in
            this reality. 
            The main mission is to target the
            <a href="./tracks/07_V_Euclidean_Space/index.html">World</a>, so all could pay attention to human care key solution, that is inside of the will of Love and 
            <a href="./tracks/02_Water_Horses_Woman_Freedom/index.html">Freedom</a>, everyone can.
