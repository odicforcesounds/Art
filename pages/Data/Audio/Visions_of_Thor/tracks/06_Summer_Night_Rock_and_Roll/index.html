    <p>
      On a summer night, when the stars are bright,<br>
      Monkey takes the stage, igniting pure delight.<br>
      With rhythm in his veins and fire in his soul,<br>
      He unleashes his moves, a rock and roll flow.<br><br>

      His body sways to the pulsating beat,<br>
      As the music electrifies, his spirit takes its seat.<br>
      His feet tap the ground with a playful sound,<br>
      Each step a testament to the joy he's found.<br><br>

      Monkey spins and twirls, a whirlwind of grace,<br>
      His movements speak a language, a wild embrace.<br>
      He grooves to the melody, his spirit set free,<br>
      In this rhythmic communion, he finds his glee.<br><br>

      The crowd comes alive, caught in Monkey's sway,<br>
      As they join in the revelry, carried away.<br>
      They dance and sing, their spirits alight,<br>
      Basking in the magic of this summer night.<br><br>

      With each twist and turn, Monkey brings delight,<br>
      His presence a beacon, shining so bright.<br>
      In his dance, he embodies pure liberation,<br>
      A celebration of life, a joyful sensation.<br><br>

      So let the music play, let the rhythm take hold,<br>
      As Monkey takes center stage, bold and bold.<br>
      In this summer night's rock and roll affair,<br>
      His dance ignites a spark, a moment so rare.
