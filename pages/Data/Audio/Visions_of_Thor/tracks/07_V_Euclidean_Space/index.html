				that loved so much, that they dream about it, which did result in groups
				of individuals producing everything they could to make that dream
				reality in the name of the called <b>Freedom</b> which is a process of
				transformation, not a pure world wide libertation of "something" that
				each need to find in the self, while dreams are always something!
			</p>

				While he becomes a monster, because he feels the need to destroy some
				building and probably kill someone else above him self, this romance was
				very good! Looks like "love" is not always right, while have always good
				visions and is for them many wal walk for!
			</p>

			<p>
				Creative people around the world, use their creativity focused in
				technology to make a "Revolution", is what they call, while again, this
				is only a process because Revolution is every single day ( it is
				happening ), which is good and less good at the same time. You know,
				running free is awesome, while if... something wrong happen, being free
				becomes hell. No one is there to help you? While in society where the
				control happens the same "wrongness" can happen and normally, someone
				will help.
			</p>
			<p>
				I really love the concept of "freedom", while freedom can be reached in
				many moments of life, while this freedom the movie talks is about the
				government control and all the stupid behaviors many do in the way of
				playing this game of being something to someone, while being something
				more to many more!
