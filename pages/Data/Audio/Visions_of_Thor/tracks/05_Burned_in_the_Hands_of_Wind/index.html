    <p>Letter of Love that express the resume of full dream.</p><br>
    <p>Which include, reality!(previsions)</p><br>
    <br>
    <p>
      My dearest Buddha, embodiment of compassion,<br>
      In the vastness of your love, I find my salvation. <br>
      Your teachings, like a gentle breeze, soothe my weary soul,<br>
      Guiding me towards enlightenment, making me whole.<br>

      But in the depths of my devotion, I stand perplexed,<br>
      For my nature, oh Shiva, is fiery and complex.<br>
      The winds of passion swirl within my being,<br>
      Threatening to consume, to leave me unseeing.<br>

      In the stillness of your presence, I hear your plea,<br>
      "Out of compassion for me, don't destroy my gifts," you decree.<br>
      And so, I grapple with this paradox, this divine dance,<br>
      Balancing the flames of my essence, taking a chance.<br>

      For I am the one burned in the hands of wind,<br>
      Caught between the flames and the silence, twinned.<br>
      In the tempest of my existence, there lies a truth,<br>
      A cacophony of noise, a silent melody, uncouth.<br>

      But in this chaos, I find solace and release,<br>
      Embracing the contradictions, finding inner peace.<br>
      For it is within the dance of opposites, my dear,<br>
      That the symphony of existence becomes clear.<br>

      In the noisy silence, I surrender to the flow,<br>
      Embracing the impermanence, letting it all go.<br>
      For in the hands of wind, I find liberation's call,<br>
      Ablaze with passion, yet surrendering to the fall.<br>

      So, my beloved Buddha, with love I write,<br>
      Navigating this path, through darkness and light.<br>
      In this eternal dance, where opposites collide,<br>
      I find the truth of my being, with you by my side.<br>

      Burned in the hands of wind, amidst noisy silence,<br>
      I embrace the paradox, the divine violence.<br>
      For it is in the fusion of elements, my love,<br>
      That I transcend, and soar to worlds above.<br>

      With profound devotion and unwavering grace,<br>
      I seek enlightenment, in this sacred space.<br>
      In the dance of our souls, let our spirits combine,<br>
      As we journey together, beyond space and time.
