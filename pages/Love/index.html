   href="../Data/Audio/Noise_Frequency/tracks/04_Not_Bad_Wrong/index.html">wrong</a>, while you always need to bring 
          to the top what I dream, because the dream is the same, not the condition of expression... You know.. To the one who wish to reach perfection (you), you always need to
          find bugs like (me) to make a decision... is what old knowledge say's, while if I am offensive, is because it looks like "no one" cares,
          while I always Care to see the <a href="../Data/Audio/Only_Tributes/tracks/12_Gift_Simplicity/index.html">simplicity</a> of it, because is fun and simple, while I focus on the ones who care only about them
          selfs, since what is <a href="../YinYang/Tao/index.html">real</a> is, that you are symbol of protection, which always resulted in your
          condition, that lead you to your eternal dutty, to become King/Queen in our reality, while it happens only when you do it for me, because you are the one who
          understand the deep content that is always in me!!! While You are the "monkey" who doesn't Talk, Should I remember you that I am the one who doesn't Listen?, while You know you should work together with the one who doesn't See, to make me better for eternity! 
          That is Your Eternal Duty, so your soul can be saved, from all the bad things you did.. in Time.. by the same condition to continue, to become better than
          the past, releasing us from what we had done... While this message is for You, this message is as well for the one who doesn't See.. ( your
          best Enemy ) or maybe your best friend in the business area, since you
          both, and many more spread their produced content in many areas too...

          You know I Love a lot of things they do and did, like I Love many things You do and did (not only Music) 
          This is and always be my style, between offensive and funny, so I can have some luck and make you smile. 
          So I think to myself, Keep reading so you understand the feeling of my misery. </p>
