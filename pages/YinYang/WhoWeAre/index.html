				More than anything, a single one, with no more than
				<span style="color: lightgreen">1%</span> different from others humans.
				The face is different, and many others aspects related to the human body
				are <span style="color: lightblue">99%</span> equal to many. It means we
				are the same body with different exterior aspects, that can be judge
				with different hierarchic levels of beauty. But then, each one of us
				have the same tool with different perspectives to deal and understand
				itself and the world around. In that aspect, we can be
				<span style="color: lightblue">99%</span> different with
				<span style="color: lightgreen">1%</span> equal, or in the shadows of
				verbal interpretations, <span style="color: lightblue">99%</span> equal
				and <span style="color: lightgreen">1%</span> different from each one of
				all people who lived, lives and it will live! So, even with all that
				difference, or equivalence, we are more or less
				<span style="color: lightblue">99%</span> equal to each other. So there
				is no problem at all, but many solutions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Interpretations of emotions is an inside process, that some don’t
				reflect an interpretation of itself but an spontaneous act of choice,
				and others, that were not done, a complex verbal expression that can be
				described as music, poetry, paint and many others ways that are related
				to human history ( art and expression ). Art can be found in history as
				choking or simply as an emotion that will give us the freedom to give
				our own interpretation about that image, sound, reading, colors, moves,
				etc...
			</p>
			<p>
				Most expressions need to be related to Earth, just because earth is the
				floor where we all live. Earth is our Home, and Earth is censorial, and
				Mother of Life in a random place of this Galaxy, of a random Galaxy of
				Universe. Earth is a lucky Planet that have everything that We need to
				exist, Water and Air, without forgetting the Fire, that can exist with
				different proprieties out of this planet, or out of this galaxy, but in
				all stars, Sun’s of random galaxies, that have random planets with the
				possibility of <span style="color: lightgreen">1%</span> to have life
				forms in a universe more or less
				<span style="color: lightblue">99%</span> equal to itself. Well, I can
				imagine that is <span style="color: lightblue">99%</span> equal as its
				architecture but not as its forms or proprieties, because many of the
				techniques of creativity or creation are
				<span style="color: lightgreen">1%</span> of
				<span style="color: lightblue">99%</span> of the logical thinking
				process that is based of rationality, discipline and repetition. Any
				creation is a new perspective that is no less than
				<span style="color: lightblue">99%</span> equal to all the rational and
				logical techniques tools that can be used as shadows of verbal
				interpretation perspective, that is
				<span style="color: lightblue">99%</span> equal and
				<span style="color: lightgreen">1%</span> different from each one of all
				people who lived, lives and it will live, that represents the Core
				Knowledge of life creation.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, even with all that difference, or equivalence, we are more or less
				<span style="color: lightblue">99%</span> equal to each other.
			</p>
			<p>
				Any creation is a new perspective that is no less than
				<span style="color: lightblue">99%</span> equal to all the rational and
				logical techniques tools that can be used as a tool or simple technique
				of expression.
			</p>
			<p>
				Intelligence is only a technique or tool that makes abstracts relations
				with abstracts or non-abstracts objects, without the need of having a
				full knowledge of each object, as the lamp of creativity is. A simple
				tool that make relations of many things without the need of having a
				full knowledge of each object to use abstracts or non-abstracts objects
				and create a new form, tool, expression, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="color: lightblue">99%</span> of the work that I called
				“OdicforceSounds” is a full creative story that use many of abstracts or
				non-abstracts objects that were in my mind, living news and school
				learning knowledge that I have no deep knowledge to all objects, and
				with a single and simple sequence of objects that can be related to an
				abstract object, that is for those who ear, something less abstract that
				really is. ( sound, emotion and expression )
			</p>
			<p>
				This history more than anything is about my perception of time, that in
				fact is my expression, the unique human propriety that humanity try to
				share and conserve to remember it self as human.
			</p>
			<p>
				No is not related to friends, family or anyone or community in their
				<span style="color: lightblue">99%</span> difference between each others
				and <span style="color: lightgreen">1%</span> equal in their structure,
				but my self as center of the world (that is not True), but pure theory  
                                which many call it as "Philosophy" ... even for the condition of the philosopher <a href="../../Data/Audio/Dao_Touch/tracks/06_Mystic_Portal/index.html">Solipsism</a> is his condition. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Truth is, that we are all simple signals of emotions, and expressions.
				Each one of us, alone with many others alone, in their own body's.
			</p>
			<p>
				The will of being in this loneliness self is the start point to
				understand what kind of social duty we need to have to complete our
				self's. The joy of living in community. In fact, we all live in
				communities, even when we are with our public or non-public group of
				people which we normally call them friends, or closely, family. The
				place that we are what we like to be. Normally when each one do what
				ever each one want to, in their community space, is in a state of Love
				and Compassion, not only for it self but to those in the Community.
			</p>
			<p>
				The screams of a baby that don’t use worlds, but the compassionate
				caring love of her mother that understand what she wants. A silent
				acknowledgment of a smile that give us more than words.
			</p>
			<p>
				What human life is more than an expression? An expression of existence.
				This is where the story begone. The <b>Love</b> Letter that grumbler the
				<b>Vibrational Zone</b>. As any interpretation of any emotion can be
				<span style="color: lightblue">99%</span> to
				<span style="color: lightgreen">1%</span> common to others sense, images
				can be used to express emotions. How sweet is to share an emotion, a
				dream, a life, our own expression of our own
				<a

					>Simplicity</a
				>.

                                  <p>Creativity and Improvisation, called many times as Intelligence.</p> 
			<p>
				With the full description of news around the World, that didn't found
				tools to talk and share without using weapons, I made a relation to
				North Mythology, in their abstract object of a symbolic emotional
				expression of War. All the solutions related to this story that are not
				Music, Paint and Lyric Expressions, are the
				<span style="color: lightgreen">1%</span> of it self, represented by me
				as Gifts that I wish no one destroy them, because more than funny as
				fantasy can be, they are really good tools for all of us, because we all
				know how much we love to play games.
			</p>
			<p>
				We need to believe that change is inside of us, then, us as one
				Expression of Existence.
			</p>
			<p>
				While <span style="color: white">Buddha</span> can be the Simplicity of
				Discipline that aims to be stable,
				<span style="color: white">Shiva</span> have different approach of
				how stability can be aim to the self as an emotion.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my non-fully knowledge of all abstracts or non-abstracts objects that
				each God have in their own religion concept of it self, I make relations
				that makes a fully fantasy story with a mix of different perspectives of
				the same probability of cause:
				<span style="color: lightblue">99%</span> of real information about each
				God is different from the other, but
				<span style="color: lightgreen">1%</span> equal in the message
				technique.
			</p>
			<p>
				So I had this dream or image in my mind that is only a dream like many
				others that have sense or not, and because it was in my head, it was
				real for me, but for you can only be a peace of emotions that I express
				writing, abstracts images or mix of colors, and electronic music that
				can be the best way to mix any kind of music with a
				<span style="color: lightblue">1%</span> different music that will make
				a <span style="color: lightgreen">99%</span> of creativity or emotion.
			</p>
			<p>
				I Love Existence, Philosophy but mostly Religions ( message ) that are
				living concepts of <b>Civic Actions</b>, not only for humans, but for
				animals ( as we all are ) !!!
