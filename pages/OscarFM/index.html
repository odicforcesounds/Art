        Sun Wukong is a simple monkey who spend his life dreaming and writing
        about the dreams he had. This monkey is not a king, as society did not
        consider him as such, but he knew he could be a king on his own. That's
        how he continues to live, but this monkey always has something to say,
        and therefore, not all the animals in the jungle pay attention to the
        lessons he tries to teach. The animals in the jungle are subject to the
        condition of all living beings, conscious or not of their actions. This
        condition is called
        <a href="../Data/Audio/Dao_Touch/tracks/06_Mystic_Portal/index.html"
          >solipsism</a
        >, which is a theory that is both true and false at the same time. This
        monkey is a creation of the author of this text, who also considers
        himself a bit of a
        <a href="../Data/Audio/The_Flow_of_Energy/tracks/03_Monkey/index.html"
          >monkey</a
        >
        because the Chinese zodiac signs say that the author is a monkey. It is
        from this fantasy that the

          href="../Data/Audio/Shamanic_Quest_Dream/tracks/02_We_Bring_Fire/index.html"
          >fire</a
        >
        of this story is born and endures over time, and the author has decided
        to self-declare himself as "Sun Wukong". In fact the story of Sun Wukong
        is considered "the best story in Chinese culture," but the author of
        this text and this web page is far from China and has never had contact
        with it. The author is, from this moment on, Sun Wukong. I, Sun Wukong,
        would like to present a solution to the animal kingdom so that there are
        better choices and each animal is valued for their choices. Especially
        the predators, such as Tigers and Lions, Wolves, Bears, Dogs,
        <a
          href="../Data/Audio/Only_Tributes/tracks/01_Dogs_Like_to_Dance/index.html"
          >and</a
        >
        Cats. They should improve their social qualities and
        <a
          href="../Data/Audio/Space_Trip/tracks/02_Organized_Classic_Motion/index.html"
          >control</a
        >
        their instinctive animality. Because they demonstrate more strength over
        other animals, they are the first to violate all the principles of their
        function in the jungle. In society and today, these animals have been
        associated with law enforcement, and therefore, they are seen as
        judicial members. Fortunately, the world has become less beastly than
        ancient history demonstrates, but the behavioral tendencies of these
        animals are ingrained in their souls, and sometimes, there are
        uncontrollable actions, as well as demonstrations of the development of
        immoral practices against the innocent. The
        <a
          href="../Data/Audio/Visions_of_Thor/tracks/10_Shake_My_Snakes/index.html"
          >Serpent</a
        >
        should also know how to control its animality, as it is used by
        Medicine, an organization that kills thousands of animals in the pursuit
        of knowledge and the various solutions we know today. With that said, we
        should consider the purely military side, represented for centuries as
        the Dragon. The Dragon has compulsive problems with
        <a
          href="../Data/Audio/Deep_Random_Meanings/tracks/06_Perfection/index.html"
          >perfection</a
        >
        and feels very uncomfortable when something is imperfect, and this
        "something" is any behavior. The Dragon accepts imperfection when it
        represents genuineness and naturalness, as well as honesty. The Dragon
        is a lover of the possibilities that animals can
        <a
          href="../Data/Audio/The_Long_Road/tracks/09_Developing_Unkown_Code/index.html"
          >develop</a
        >
        through their unbreakable and meticulously defined disciplines, based on
        the knowledge of centuries of the history of this planet. The oldest
        knowledge says that the Dragon will honor the Monkey King's choice. The
        monkey is not carnivorous, not a
        <a
          href="../Data/Audio/Path_Of_Shields/tracks/02_Dark_Warrior/index.html"
          >warrior</a
        >
        who uses conventional weapons, but literary and musical weapons. This
        text is part of the message that the
        <a href="../Data/Audio/Path_Of_Shields/tracks/25_The_Dragon/index.htwl"
          >Dragon</a
        >
        will carefully read in order to understand the reasons that motivated
        the Monkey King to make this decision, as well as to try to manipulate
        reality so that the monkey's
        <a
          href="../Data/Audio/Dao_Expression/tracks/05_Hunting_Dreams_Hunters/index.html"
          >dream</a
        >
        is fulfilled. The predators feel victimized because they cannot use
        violent techniques to achieve their goals. The Monkey King knows that
        they are all capable of achieving the goal without the use of additional
        tools, beyond their social abilities. Courage must be associated with
        their ability to adapt to irregular circumstances and act in a subtle,
        polite, and precise manner. The capacity for self-control is taught to
        rational animals, but the education of irrational animals has the same
        effect. It doesn't matter whether the being is rational or not, but
        rather the educational process that should avoid, as much as possible,
        violent practices aimed at educating. Animals are not machines, and
        machines do not deserve to be violated because they have failed. The
        Monkey King has a dream that will create a positive revolution for the
        jungle
