    Monkey King was unlike any other monkey in the jungle. He have a dream, a dream that went beyond swinging through the trees and feasting on delicious fruits. Monkey King wanted to teach the mighty Tigers and Lions, who are represented in reality, as the police forces, and the powerful Dragons, who are represented in reality as the military knowledge, to control their wild <a href="../Data/Audio/Space_Trip/tracks/02_Organized_Classic_Motion/index.html">instincts</a> and be kinder to the weaker creatures in the jungle.

Now, you might wonder why Monkey King have such an ambitious dream. Well, it all began with a little incident that opened Monkey King's eyes to the unfairness in the jungle.

One sunny morning, as Monkey King was swinging from vine to vine, he came across a group of baby animals playing by a sparkling river. There were little deer, rabbits, and even a tiny tortoise, all giggling and having the time of their lives. Monkey King couldn't help but join in the fun. He played games, told funny stories, and made the little ones laugh until their bellies hurt.

As the day went on, Monkey King noticed that the jungle's fiercest residents, the Tigers and Lions, who served as the police force, are patrolling the area. They were supposed to keep the jungle safe, but Monkey King soon realized that they were doing quite the opposite.

One young lion cub, in particular, have a habit of scaring the baby animals by roaring loudly. Monkey King watched as the little ones trembled in fear, and his heart sank. He knew something need to be done.

That evening, Monkey King gathered all the baby animals around him and decided to have a heart-to-heart talk. He said, "My dear friends, I've noticed that the Tigers and Lions are not being very kind to you. It's not right that they use their strength to scare and intimidate you. We must find a way to teach them to <a href="../Data/Audio/Machine_World/tracks/03_Control_Free_to_Ask/index.html">control</a> their animality, so they can be fair and gentle."

The baby animals nodded in agreement, and together, they hatched a plan. They would go to the Tigers and Lions and try to explain how their actions are hurting the jungle's harmony. Monkey King, being the brave and charismatic monkey that he was, would be their spokesperson.

The next morning, Monkey King and the baby animals approached the Tiger and Lion leaders, who were resting under the shade of a massive tree. Monkey King cleared his throat and began, "Dear leaders, we come in <a href="../Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/tracks/01_We_Came_in_Peace/index.html">peace</a> and with a humble request. We understand that you are the protectors of our jungle, but sometimes, your actions scare and hurt the weaker creatures."

The Tiger and Lion leaders exchanged glances but remained silent, allowing Monkey King to continue.

Monkey King continued, "We <a href="../Data/Audio/Eternal_Delay/tracks/08_You_Dont_Believe/index.html">believe</a> that you have the power to control your animality and show courage to all inhabitants of our jungle. We want to live in harmony and not fear your roars and growls. Can you find it in your hearts to change your ways and protect us with love instead of fear?"

The Tiger and Lion leaders are taken aback by Monkey King's words. They had never been approached like this before, and they had never thought about the impact of their actions on the smaller animals. After a moment of reflection, the Tiger leader stepped forward and said, "You have shown great courage by coming to us, Monkey King. We will discuss this among ourselves and see if we can change our ways."

With that, Monkey King and the baby animals returned to their friends, hopeful that they make a difference. Word of their meeting with the Tiger and Lion leaders spread throughout the jungle, and it gave the animals a glimmer of hope.

One sunny day, Monkey King embarked on a journey to the Dragon's lair, a majestic mountain at the heart of the jungle. It was said that the Dragons possessed immense power and could breathe <a href="../Data/Audio/Shamanic_Quest_Dream/tracks/02_We_Bring_Fire/index.html">fire</a>, but Monkey King was determined to bring his message of peace to them.

After a long and arduous journey, Monkey King reached the Dragon's lair. He stood at the entrance, feeling tiny compared to the enormous dragons that lay within. With a deep breath, he stepped forward and said, "Mighty Dragons, I come to you with a humble request. Just like the Tigers and Lions, your actions sometimes hurt the weaker creatures of our jungle. We believe that you can control your animality and protect us with <a href="../Data/Audio/Path_Of_Shields/tracks/01_Because_we_Love/index.html">love</a> instead of fear. Will you hear our plea?"

The Dragons, who were initially surprised by Monkey King's presence, looked at each other and nodded. They have never been approached in such a manner, and they are intrigued by Monkey King's words. The Dragon leader, a wise and ancient creature, spoke, "You have shown great courage, little <a href="../Data/Audio/The_Flow_of_Energy/tracks/03_Monkey/index.html">monkey</a>. We will discuss this among ourselves and see if we can <a href="../Data/Audio/The_Long_Road/tracks/05_We_Must_Change_Our_Ways/index.html">change</a> our ways."

Monkey King returned to the jungle, his heart filled with hope once again. He knew that change wouldn't happen overnight, but he had planted the seed of courage in the hearts of the mighty Dragons.

Monkey King's <a href="../Data/Audio/Dao_Expression/tracks/05_Hunting_Dreams_Hunters/index.html">dream</a> of teaching the Tigers, Lions, and Dragons to control their animality and be fair to the weak creatures can become true. 

Over time, the jungle became a shining example of how even the mightiest and fiercest creatures could learn to control their instincts and live in harmony with the weaker ones. The Tigers, Lions, and <a href="../Data/Audio/Path_Of_Shields/tracks/25_The_Dragon/index.html">Dragons</a> will become protectors of peace, and the jungle will thrive without their violence actions.
