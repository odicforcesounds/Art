# The Condition (Tao)

## code(html+css+js) + text-content + pull_request

- Notes:

  1. The Content that is in the suggestion to be changed ( or upgrade information about it ) needs to be in:
     1. pages/Data/Audio/ALBUM_NAME/tracks/TRACK_NUMBER/ ( English Only )
     2. pages/Data/Videos/TOPIC/SPECIFIC_VIDEO_TITLE ( Portuguese Only )
        - Note: if you understand Portuguese, be <b>SURE</b> you read the main page refering the VIDEOS, before anything else!!!
        - Note that most of the Video content, is in Portuguese Language and most of them are sensible content ( +18 ) ( no PORN )
        - Videos can only be accessed by Link, not by searching Youtube.
        - All Comments are controlled. (if you don't wish to make them public, tell me in that comment)
  2. Each Video can have a big text refering knowledge. (knowledge can be defined as something real or imaginary -> Comparative )
     1. VIDEOS (PT): If you wish to add more, please setup a new page in pages/Data/Videos/VIDEO_TITLE refering the Video and description. (you can do better than me)
     2. AUDIO (EN): If you wish to add more, please setup a new page in pages/Data/Audio/ALBUM/tracks/TRACK_NUMBER refering the Audio Track and description.
     3. Example:
        1. pages/Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/tracks/12_Hacking_Festival/index.html
        - You know that are billions of websites sharing content about hacking..
        - This is just one single page, that can become better! ( Your Freedom to share the best )
        - Maybe can have several themes..
        - Maybe can refer to better links..
        - Maybe you will contribute.
  3. Each page can use HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Expression

## Last words

- Monkey hopes to find as many contribuitions each singularity on Earth can share, while that is too much, maybe the best from each singularity is a good choice.
- Let me know and if you wish to tell me something:
  1. Please considere to comment one of my videos on Youtube ( for personal comments )
  2. Send me an email to OM @ OdicforceSounds DOT com ( for business )
  3. Please understand that Monkey like to know, you like monkey artwork site, while monkey is searching for an advice, so if you don't mind, you may criticise what ever you see that can become better, giving me suggestions about it.
  - ( in any artwork content ) and ( in any video content ), Monkey ask that your negative expression about anything Monkey did express, should use logic ( comparative content that is described in text that points to your opinion, saying that Monkey opinion is wrong )
  - Monkey can become better, which means: Monkey can change the way, Monkey thinks. ( new perspectives are always welcome! )
- About Monkeys Gifts, Application:
  1. Read the Document related to them.
  2. Emails refer to users
  3. GPS refer to actions
  4. Make a realtime animation of each action around the world? ( I am not able to do that while I can imagine someone can )
