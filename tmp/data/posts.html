Maybe I cannot spam my work to all companies in the world, but at least I am not blocked from use mastodon just because &quot;You&quot; want. I mean, all admins have that right, with or without an explanation, but those actions are made because someone did abuse within the security of the platform it self. Even then, there is a lot of people who are trying to break everything, the code and so on. Is some platforms they would considere to reward the one who break the platform if the breaker aims to make the <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/network\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>network</span></a> platform, better. Glad some companies have that attitude to those who present their actions within the intention to make things better. I don&#39;t know about, &quot;how it works&quot;, but if the breaker can fix the problem, we may need to considere to reward the breaker. If the breaker can only break but doesn&#39;t solve the problem, we may need to considere to arrest or punish the breaker. I like that aspect of using ethics to explore and test software in the security IT groups. With Kali linux we don&#39;t need need to compile our software. With those UIs, we don&#39;t even need to know what we are doing, because is by testing that we know what we are doing. Same for programming, same for exploring a application, same for learning a new language. Copy, paste, copy paste, is how we think we learn, but we deny we only repeat the ride. Oh now I understand... Do You? Because you did a lot of mistakes to reach that! When security persons aim to teach others, persons do less mistakes, when security persons aim to show how good they are, persons do more mistakes. Oh yes, even for living, most of us did learn by what other do, not by what others say we should or not do, since most denies, didn&#39;t have a logic explanation, which result in the need to explore what is refused to get more. The perspective of having the &quot;bad&quot; working for the health of &quot;good&quot; is not bad, if we educate the bad to be good. Is like teaching. We don&#39;t know if the student will follow our teachments, and we don&#39;t know if the student will become passionated to the subject we are teaching, but educational systems are the key to everything. The Students will grow with that knowledge in mine. In Time they will use that knowledge to create new things or to repeat the same things, but without it, not even evolution would be possible. <br /><a href=\"https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/The_Long_Road/tracks/05_We_Must_Change_Our_Ways/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" translate=\"no\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://</span><span class=\"ellipsis\">art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/</span><span class=\"invisible\">Data/Audio/The_Long_Road/tracks/05_We_Must_Change_Our_Ways/index.html</span></a><br /><a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/severncullissuzuki\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>severncullissuzuki</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/Canada\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>Canada</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/ClimateChange\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>ClimateChange</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/Tribute\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>Tribute</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/America\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>America</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/Business\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>Business</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/Asia\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>Asia</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/Economy\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>Economy</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/Africa\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>Africa</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/Freedom\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>Freedom</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/Liberty\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>Liberty</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/ukraine\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>ukraine</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/Russia\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>Russia</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/Japan\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>Japan</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/China\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>China</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/USA\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>USA</span></a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/UK\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>UK</span></a></p><p>I like this little detail of being &quot;offensive&quot; without being offensive directly to you.<br />You can attack something without being someone.

So we can expose our subjective emotions into something that is &quot;real&quot; but is not someone! So we can &quot;save&quot; others from our emotions.. while if they have a title, maybe those who listen, find the same emotion or similar, to the one I find listening those tracks.. You know.. some people say it right, is not what but how, and the how deals with sound, which is a pointer to the way someone deals with any information. And since society did develop a way to ignore emotions, since they part most of their own time of life, working for someone else dream to grow, you can use art ( music, pain, dance, whatever ) to &quot;remove&quot; those.. since we could create a object that represents that... Is like <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/science\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>science</span></a>, when they formulate a object that represent the &quot;core&quot; information that can be used or at least &quot;pointed&quot; as a possibility, they leave the object to future use. Self therapy can be archived in several ways. This is my way, while if I mostly improvise, I don&#39;t feed the emotion for more time, which can be wise. How do you win the storm? If you try to win the storm you become the storm, so tell me, how do you win the storm? Well, I don&#39;t know about you, but I just ignore it and if is needed, I run away from it.

Being logic in the perspective of interacting with society is &quot;being evil&quot;, just because we need to put emotions away from the observation and interpretation process. In any case, we all need to be evil in some portion of reality, even to be &quot;safe&quot;, but I really believe in the practical exercices that each can do + promoting non-evil actions and self characteristics, which is the most value fragment of the action it self. That is my challenge, and even if is as well &quot;evil&quot;, it doesn&#39;t intent to give control to others, but to guide others in self control. <br />-<br />I don&#39;t really like or agree with the style of educating &quot;self control&quot; using agressive or violent techniques, but those who use to educate, can be part of another evilness that is a more evil than mine, which is the &quot;point&quot; where each become more or less evil, to the self and to other self&#39;s. <br />-<br />The Condition of illusion is awesome. In the perspective of finding any subject in reality or tools to manipulate reality. Nothing against, but the &quot;connections&quot; are not all focusing the same propose, which result in more negative evilness. <br />- <br />History prove that wars didn&#39;t solve problems, but feed them. <br />-<br />Is like old memories where their events in Time already gone, remembering them, feeds them.</p>",

Talvez um pouco antes da pólvora ser inventada. Desde então, milhares de pessoas no mundo, apaixonaram-se por objectos que servem o propósito da penetração de outros corpos sem a sua permissão, para que dessa forma pudessem reinar. Infelizmente, a paixão foi de tal ordem profunda, que os pequenos objectos transformaram-se em objectos monstruosamente grandes, capazes de penetrar vários milheres de corpos num só instante. Diga-se de forma formal, que estes objectos parecem falos, e sendo que são projectados, talvez sejam tentativas de criar novos filhos, sendo que na verdade a única função que esses objectos têm, é a de destruir. <br />---<br />A justiça teria uma função de continuidade da educação, mas não, a justiça como função puramente documental e juridica, pode ser útil, mas quanto à abordagem da necessidade de &quot;fazer justiça&quot; é que deverá haver mudanças profundas, quanto à forma como os soldados, agentes e restantes membros das sociedades que &quot;estão predispostos a defender os seus&quot; ( e não os negócios ), devem ter com o resto da população. A primeira regra deveria ser: Não usar armas, pois só &quot;os não soldados é que poderiam precisar de uma, pois não sabem lutar&quot;. <br />A segunda regra seria: aprender a educar de forma não violenta. ( de certo que a educação pode estudar este tipo de questões psíquicas do comportamento humano, para que seja possível melhorar o conteúdo informativo e instrumental de todos os &quot;agentes judiciais&quot; que sentem necessidade de fazer justiça por si próprios, pois estão a cumprir essa função, sendo que a mesma só pode ter resolução oficial, no tribunal. Os tribunais também têm problemas. Tudo tem problemas! <br />-<br />Os governos são um pouco menos corruptos do que a industria, mas existe algum em comum com todos os sistemas, legais ou ilegais: Dinheiro. O objecto que oferece a função da liberdade de escolha de acção. &quot;Expressões numéricas que represetam valor&quot; ... </p><p>- </p><p>Antes e durante o processo escolar, existe uma tentativa de guiar os alunos a terem boas escolhas. Mesmo havendo esse sistema, eventos imprevistos acontecem. Se o sistema judicial se desliga dos princípios educativos, só poderemos ter corrupção em todos os sentidos judiciais.. isto é, sociais. ( sem economia incluída )... sendo que a economia é o factor principal das acções de corrupção do outro cidadão. Depois temos necessidades de elevação e opressão por &quot;prazer&quot; e sabe-se lá que mais :) .. sempre em prol do dinheiro, não propriamente em prol de algo &quot;maior&quot;. <br />-<br />Por isso digo e volto a dizer: &quot; Se o tempo está escrito na nossa memória, então a expressão do tempo é a expressão da nossa memória, como função do tempo!&quot; ..

É pena que a maioria dos militares se tenha apaixonado pelas armas, pois a sua função deveria estar na prevenção de qualquer perigo para a população, mas com armas na mão, tudo isso é em vão, pois nem todo o soldado sabe se auto dominar a sua emoção, que lhe oferece a tentação de reinar e manipular a realidade. <br />-<br />Eu cá imagino: na recruta são pelo menos dois meses com exercícios duros. Com organização e método, todos os soldados teriam a capacidade de prevenir este tipo de práticas bem comuns nas sociedades, pois sabemos que até o pinheiro ou o eucapílto, não iriam arder mesmo que nascessem no meio de Deserto, mas sim se um raio lhes cair em cima.

The defensive and the offensive. <br />But sharing the offensive tools for free to everyone else, result in random exploitation, even from people who don&#39;t know anything about security, since the application can do what ever they can&#39;t. <br />... The American people can tell me I am wrong on that aspect, but please, if you are american, you know about the gun problem. <br />The random mass murders happen because someone have access to those tools that everyone knows that can only be used to kill or destroy. There is no other utility on those. <br />Even then, they are freely given. So the moral and ethic problem I wish to open in here is: <br />if we already know the result of the effect of using those tools, and the condition that create those events in reality and &quot;we&quot; do nothing, then who ever use those tools cannot be criminalized, because the &quot;guilty&quot; is firstly the ones who share those tools, not the ones who did use them.

Eis uma problemática tramada, pois o perfeccionista irá sentir-se de tal modo desconfortável com o erro dos outros que transforma-se e fica agressivo ou violento. Assim era o tratamento de vários alunos de um professor de música que não sabia auto-dominar as suas emoções enquanto profissional. Uma problemática milenar, pois sabe-se que ainda no séculos passado e também no actual, milhares de crianças ou até adultos, são vitimas de violencia por causa de aspectos simples e ridiculos que só podem ser corrigidos via o treino e não via a técnica violenta e agressiva que muitos foram vitimas. Esse problema pode ser detectado me vários pontos e grupos da actualidade, onde o &quot;deitar abaixo&quot; o próximo é a técnica que garante algum tipo de resultado positivo. É assim considerado por causa dos efeitos imediatos, mas pondo de lado os efeitos colaterais. O pior dos efeitos colaterais é que a vitima poderá um dia mais tarde, fazer o mesmo a outra pessoa, acreditando que está a fazer a melhor escolha, pois foi essa que usaram para ela. Assim se dá continuidade a aspectos comportamentais que deveriam ser corrigidos e que nada tem a ver com racismo, mesmo que tal atitude, seja altamenta discriminatória e que por consequencia da falta de auto-domínio, insulta a vítima como  primeiro passo para rebaixa-la.</p>",

O sofrimento está antes de tudo no sacrifício que temos de ter, para sabermos lidar com os outros. <br />Mas se pensarmos, esse sofrimento é tão superficial que nem é considerado sofrimento. Contúdo, a origem do sofrer, está nesse problema de memória que todos teremos de lidar, como experiencia das nossas vidas. As memórias são tramadas e elas conseguem transformar o ser. Elas repetem-se ciclicamente e nem toda a gente compreende. Claro, o solipsismo é a nossa condição existencial. Uma teoria falsa e positiva ao mesmo tempo... quando a humanidade aceitar a simplicidade, através do conhecimento, tudo é possível.

Até parece que existe música coral satânica ou anti-cristã, para considerarem declarar-se como um estilo de música religioso. A Religião ( seja ela qual for ), tem exercícios musicais para &quot;facilitar&quot; a conecção entre o crente e Deus e isso não pede mais do que a voz do crente, sem melodia, sem palavras de ordem, sem uma vontade que se auto-declara original. Deixem de copiar os &quot;maus&quot; para se mostrarem &quot;bons&quot; .. a música é música.. ela é espiritual porque toda a música é capaz de transmitir emoções sem o uso do VERBO e sem VERBO não há factualidade de nada.. nem das subjectividades do ser. Dizer que a música não tradicional &quot;como produto original&quot;, é estragar e desrespeitar a unicidade da música. É como o &quot;Black Metal&quot;. Todas as bandas que se associaram ao satanismo ou às políticas extremistas, dentro de um estilo sonoro que serve antes de tudo, a descrição das más sensações que todos temos de lidar, é manipulação a total desrespeito pela música.
